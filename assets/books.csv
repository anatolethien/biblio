Why are so many young people drawn to pipe collecting and artistic pipe making with such intensity and passion, and why are pipe shows suddenly sold out, with waiting lists for tables? These young pipe enthusiasts are from America, Germany, Russia, Japan, China, Italy, Denmark and all over the world.Unlike mass-marketed cigarettes, pipe smoking has a rich tradition that goes back many centuries, and the author predicts it is the only form of smoking that will last many centuries into the future. He contends that moderate pipe smoking, without inhaling, promotes relaxation and clear thinking, and it serves as an ideal antidote to stress that is much safer than the tranquilizers that are so freely dispensed today.Unlike cigar and cigarette smokers, pipe collectors actually save their pipes. They clean and polish them and put them in racks or display cabinets. If they are broken, they have them repaired. Most pipe smokers remember when they bought each pipe in their collection, and every time they take a pipe out, it is a reminder of the past, to be enjoyed in the present, for many years into the future.This book also is inspiring because of Rick Newcombe's enthusiasm and optimism, which shine through in every chapter and make it a fast-paced and enjoyable read.",152.0,229.0,10.0,1,9781939104038,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/9391/9781939104038.jpg,1939104033,9781939104038,en,2014-12-29,4.0,3,Still Searching for Pipe Dreams,253.0

Pagan clashed with Christian as the seven kingdoms of the Germanic tribes warred against each other and against the native Celts. Occasionally an uneasy peace was bought by the skilful use of the 'diplomatic marriage', and twice Etheldreda, though vowed to chastity, submitted to marriage for political reasons. When her second husband refused to accept the 'arrangement' between them, she fled south, her escape to the Island of Ely apparently aided by storms that intervened on her behalf. She lived only a few years as abbess of the religious community she founded at Ely before dying of plague. Ever since, pilgrims have turned to her for miracles of help and healing. But this is not just the story of a seventh-century Anglo-Saxon saint. It is about the general human struggle to comprehend the enigma of existence and to come to terms with Christ's God, faced as we are by a violent and cruel world.

This book discusses a group of themes designed to highlight how Muslims reacted to the alien presence of the Crusaders in the heart of traditional Muslim territory.  Ideological concerns are examined and the importance of the jihad is assessed in the context of the gradual recovery of the Holy Land and the expulsion of the Crusaders.  Two chapters are devoted to an analysis of warfare - arms, battles, sieges, fortifications - on the basis of written sources and extant works of art, and the neglected aspect of the navy is brought into prominence.  One chapter deals with the complex issue of the interaction between Muslims and Crusaders in a social, economic and cultural setting.

They must rely almost entirely on their reputations to secure compliance with their decisions, obtain resources, and maintain their political influence.  In Judicial Reputation, Nuno Garoupa and Tom Ginsburg explain how reputation is not only an essential quality of the judiciary as a whole, but also of individual judges. Perceptions of judicial systems around the world range from widespread admiration to utter contempt, and as judges participate within these institutions some earn respect, while others are scorned. Judicial Reputation explores how judges respond to the reputational incentives provided by the different audiences they interact with lawyers, politicians, the media, and the public itself and how institutional structures mediate these interactions.

Larry W. Hurtado has been one of the leading scholars on early Christology for decades. In Honoring the Son: Jesus in Earliest Christian Devotional Practice, Hurtado helps readers understand early Christology by examining not just what early Christians believed or wrote about Jesus, but what their devotional practices tell us about the place of Jesus in early Christian worship. Drawing on his extensive knowledge of early Christian origins and scholarship on New Testament Christology, Hurtado examines the distinctiveness of early Christian worship by comparing it to both Jewish worship patterns and worship practices within the broader Roman-era religious environment. He argues that the inclusion of the risen Jesus alongside the Father in early Christian devotional practices was a distinct and unique religious phenomenon within its ancient context. Additionally, Hurtado demonstrates that this remarkable development was not invented decades after the resurrection of Christ as some scholars once claimed. Instead, the New Testament suggests that Jesus-followers, very quickly after the resurrection of Christ, began to worship the Son alongside the Father.

Wangari lives in the lush, green, land of rural Kenya where the soil is perfect for planting, the trees tower into the sky, and the streams are full of mysterious creatures. All day, she plays beneath her favorite fig tree, and at night she gathers around the fire with her family to listen to her mother's stories.  Then Wangari grows up and goes away to school, and things start changing at home. Farmers chop down the trees. Landslides bury the stream. The soil becomes overworked and dry, and nothing will grow. People go hungry. After all her studies, Dr. Wangari Maathai realizes there is a simple solution to these problems: plant a forest full of trees.  Dr. Wangari Maathai Plants a Forest is the story of environmentalist and activist Dr. Wangari Maathai, who became the first African woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.

Henri de Lubac has rightly been given credit for pointing this out; and to all appearances, de Lubac's influence won the day, as can be seen by the imprint of his thought upon not just the Second Vatican Council, but also the pontificates of John Paul II and Benedict XVI. However, in recent years, a new crop of Thomistic scholars has arisen who question whether de Lubac's word on nature and grace should be the last; hence, the debate over the nature-grace relation, so heated at mid-twentieth century, has been stirred once again. Dr. Swafford here offers a third way by way of the nineteenth-century German theologian Matthias J. Scheeben--who, for some reason, has never really been considered especially relevant to this debate. Swafford shows that Scheeben can capture the very best of both sides, while at the same time avoiding the characteristic pitfalls so often alleged against each. Dr. Swafford's book is highly welcome as the Catholic Church celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of the Second Vatican Council. Henri de Lubac had been a noted peritus during that council. His understanding of the nature-grace relationship informed the final form of significant conciliar documents. Swafford ably develops the parameters within which the nature-grace discussion has evolved, giving particular attention to the contemporary contributions of Lawrence Feingold and Steven Long. Using primary sources, he convincingly demonstrates how the much-celebrated but now almost forgotten theologian Matthias Scheeben offers a solution to this problem. --Emery de Gaal, University of Saint Mary of the Lake, Mundelein, IL This is more than a book: it's a milestone in Catholic intellectual history. --Scott W. Hahn, Franciscan University of Steubenville, Steubenville, OH Professor Swafford argues that the christological, nuptial, and incarnational emphases of de Lubac and his school need not be opposed to the traditional Thomistic approach to nature and grace. In fact, in the work of Matthias Scheeben, he finds precisely both emphases in profound integration. If, as I hope, the eventual fruit of this book is the translation and publication of Scheeben's Dogmatics, then this book will indeed mark a new beginning in English-speaking Catholic theology. --Matthew Levering, Mundelein Seminary, Mundelein, IL Andrew Dean Swafford holds a doctorate in Sacred Theology from the University of St. Mary of the Lake/Mundelein Seminary and a master's degree in Old Testament and Semitic Languages from Trinity Evangelical Divinity School.

The text is divided into 4 parts that establish the geodynamical environment for sedimentary basins and the physical state of the lithosphere, followed by a coverage of the mechanics of basin formation, an integrated analysis of the controls on the basin-fill and its burial and thermal history, and concludes with an application of basin analysis principles in petroleum play assessment, including a discussion of unconventional hydrocarbon plays.",216.0,283.0,26.0,1,9780470673768,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/4706/9780470673768.jpg,470673761,9780470673768,en,2013-08-26,4.45,11,Basin Analysis : Principles and Application to Petroleum Play Assessment,1554.0

Is dignity something we all share equally, and therefore the reason we all ought to be treated as equals? Or is it what distinguishes some greater and more admirable human beings from the rest? What notion of human dignity should inform our private judgments and our public life?  In Neither Beast Nor God, Gilbert Meilaender elaborates the philosophical, social, theological, and political implications of the question of dignity, and suggests a path through the thicket. Meilaender, a noted theologian and a prominent voice in America's bioethics debates, traces the ways in which notions of dignity shape societies, families, and individual lives, and incisively cuts through some common confusions that cloud our thinking on key moral and ethical questions. The dignity of humanity and the dignity of the person, he argues, are distinct but deeply connected--and only by grasping them both can we find our way to a meaningful understanding of the human condition.",163.0,240.0,15.24,2,9781594032578,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/5940/9781594032578.jpg,1594032572,9781594032578,en,2009-10-15,4.03,34,Neither Beast Nor God : The Dignity of the Human Person,341.0

On this fascinating journey, we come back to the same sorts of dinosaurs more than once as new discoveries changed ideas on their appearance, biology or behaviour.

All gardeners have experienced the frustration of having a bulb flower in the first year after planting, but poorly or never again thereafter. Judy Glattstein shows how a more naturalistic style of planting can pay greater dividends over time from healthy and thriving populations of bulbs. She uses a broad definition of bulbs, including a wide diversity of bulbs, corms, and tubers. By grouping them together with other plants that excel in similar conditions, she shows how all styles of gardens can prove more durable and require less maintenance in the long term. Perhaps most importantly, she emphasizes that choices based on climate and local ecology will yield a garden that truly 'belongs' where it has been sited. Following her extensive research and travel throughout North America to visit hundreds of gardens, Glattstein offers detailed, regionally appropriate suggestions for gardeners everywhere.",152.0,229.0,24.38,2,9780881926934,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/8819/9780881926934.jpg,881926930,9780881926934,en,2005-04-07,3.75,4,Bulbs for Garden Habitats,784.0

How did we come to spend so much of our time filling out forms? And is it really a cipher for state violence?  To answer these questions, the anthropologist David Graeber--one of our most important and provocative thinkers--traces the peculiar and unexpected ways we relate to bureaucracy today, and reveals how it shapes our lives in ways we may not even notice...though he also suggests that there may be something perversely appealing--even romantic--about bureaucracy.   Leaping from the ascendance of right-wing economics to the hidden meanings behind Sherlock Holmes and Batman, The Utopia of Rules is at once a powerful work of social theory in the tradition of Foucault and Marx, and an entertaining reckoning with popular culture that calls to mind Slavoj Zizek at his most accessible.

Those who got the philosophy right did well. Those who lacked either the imagination or the intellectual capital to understand the rapidly evolving potential of the armored vehicle failed miserably. The third story is one of organization. Gudmundsson pays particular attention to how armored vehicles were combined with other forces to form an extraordinarily rich variety of units and formations.

When Ofelia decides to chronicle her life with Luba in a tell-all book, she discovers inspiration in Luba's young children--the one-armed Casimira, Socorro with the photographic memory, the loner Joselito and the silent Conchita. The children lead Ofelia to a seemingly haunted field where the disembodied voice of a baby crying opens the floodgates of memory, even memories Ofelia has spent a lifetime trying to forget. Meanwhile, Hernandez continues to explore the complex, sometimes violent, sexual dramas that are his trademark: Luba's daughter Guadalupe is now married to Gato, who is the ex-husband of Pipo, who happens to be the producer of the TV show starring Luba's other daughter Doralis. Pipo is dating a man named Igor, who once dated Guadalupe. As if that isn't enough, Luba's beautiful, lisping therapist sister Fritz, preoccupied with two different boyfriends--famous soccer champion Sergio and gorgeous model Enrique--somehow finds time for a third man, Hector, only to change her mind and hook him up with her sister, the bodybuilder Petra.

Through encounters with artists of all kinds, famous or obscure, McKerracher traces a socio-cultural history of the meaning of writing, each vignette a meditation on the way that metaphor limits and liberates understanding: creativity is a process, a possession, a relation, an algorithm, a game, and more. But What It Means to Write is far more than an archive of the figurative. Along the way, a labyrinth of chance reunites McKerracher with old friends, threatens him with violence, and invites him to remain forever in a place both real and imagined. His journey from cafes to libraries to late-night living rooms embodies the structure of a bold new methodology for interpreting creativity, demonstrating the tools for working productively with ambiguity and rebuilding meaning, one metaphor at a time.

I mean, white isn't just a color. And maybe that's the problem for them. White is a passport. It's a ticket."" Five estranged cousins are lost in a maze of their family's tangled secrets. Their grandparents, former potato farmers Gottfried and Marla Hemmings, managed to trade digging spuds for developing subdivisions and now they sit atop a million-dollar bank account--wealth they've refused to pass on to their adult children or their five teenage grandchildren. ""Because we want them to thrive,"" Marla always says. But for the Hemmings cousins, ""thriving"" feels a lot like slowly dying of a poison they started taking the moment they were born. As the rot beneath the surface of the Hemmings' white suburban respectability destroys the family from within, the cousins find their ways back to one another, just in time to uncover the terrible cost of maintaining the family name.

We see three different choices and three different husbands: the best-friend, soul-mate husband of the one sister, who brings her great joy; the would-be companionable husband of another, who over-indulges and finally bores her; and the bullying husband who turns a high-spirited, naive young girl into a deeply unhappy woman. It is the last husband, Geoffrey, who is the most horrifying character in The Were Sisters.  Man's cruelty to woman is a frequent theme in Dorothy Whipple's novels, but nowhere was there more scope for man to be cruel to his wife than in Britain before the reform of the divorce laws. As Celia Brayfield writes in her Persephone Preface: 'Coupled with their financial dependence, but largely taken for granted because it would have been a fact of life for Whipple's readers, is the bitter truth that the middle-class woman of this time had almost no chance of freeing herself from a bad husband. Even after the Matrimonial Causes Act of 1937 a divorced woman suffered grave social disadvantages.' What has not changed is that some men are bullies and some women are married to them. 'Described as a woman who loves too much decades before those words became the title of a book about women drawn to dysfunctional partners, Charlotte marries Geoffrey, a boorish, hard-drinking salesman who swiftly evolves into a domestic dicator. Yet his blood-curdling sadism towards his wife and children is evoked without any physical violence or the use of a word stronger than ""damn"".'

Over the past half century, deaths from heart disease, stroke, and so many other killers have fallen dramatically. But cancer continues to kill with abandon. In 2013, despite a four-decade ""war"" against the disease that has cost hundreds of billions of dollars, more than 1.6 million Americans will be diagnosed with cancer and nearly six hundred thousand will die from it. A decade ago, Clifton Leaf, a celebrated journalist and a cancer survivor himself, began to investigate why we had made such limited progress fighting this terrifying disease. The result is a gripping narrative that reveals why the public's immense investment in research has been badly misspent, why scientists seldom collaborate and share their data, why new drugs are so expensive yet routinely fail, and why our best hope for progress--brilliant young scientists--are now abandoning the search for a cure. ""Through flowing prose Leaf delivers, alongside facts and data, stories on personalities involved in research, the fascinating process of solving an unusual and highly deadly cancer in Africa, and the heartbreaking realities of cancer treatment in children today. Leaf's extensively investigated treatise will resonate with researchers and patients frustrated by the bureaucratic woes he delineates.

Ninety-six percent of the ancient redwood forests have been destroyed by logging, but the untouched fragments that remain are among the great wonders of nature. The biggest redwoods have trunks up to thirty feet wide and can rise more than thirty-five stories above the ground, forming cathedral-like structures in the air. Until recently, redwoods were thought to be virtually impossible to ascend, and the canopy at the tops of these majestic trees was undiscovered. In The Wild Trees, Richard Preston unfolds the spellbinding story of Steve Sillett, Marie Antoine, and the tiny group of daring botanists and amateur naturalists that found a lost world above California, a world that is dangerous, hauntingly beautiful, and unexplored.  The canopy voyagers are young--just college students when they start their quest--and they share a passion for these trees, persevering in spite of sometimes crushing personal obstacles and failings. They take big risks, they ignore common wisdom (such as the notion that there's nothing left to discover in North America), and they even make love in hammocks stretched between branches three hundred feet in the air.  The deep redwood canopy is a vertical Eden filled with mosses, lichens, spotted salamanders, hanging gardens of ferns, and thickets of huckleberry bushes, all growing out of massive trunk systems that have fused and formed flying buttresses, sometimes carved into blackened chambers, hollowed out by fire, called ""fire caves."" Thick layers of soil sitting on limbs harbor animal and plant life that is unknown to science. Humans move through the deep canopy suspended on ropes, far out of sight of the ground, knowing that the price of a small mistake can be a plunge to one's death.  Preston's account of this amazing world, by turns terrifying, moving, and fascinating, is an adventure story told in novelistic detail by a master of nonfiction narrative. The author shares his protagonists' passion for tall trees, and he mastered the techniques of tall-tree climbing to tell the story in The Wild Trees--the story of the fate of the world's most splendid forests and of the imperiled biosphere itself.",131.0,202.0,18.0,1,9780812975598,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/8129/9780812975598.jpg,812975596,9780812975598,en,2008-02-12,4.1,6852,The Wild Trees : A Story of Passion and Daring,227.0

He started taking disciples in 1951, only after a personal revelation from his guru Sri Siddharameshwar Maharaj.

Many spiritual luminaries and well-known writers have acknowledged the impact his words have had on their lives.

Most of us grew up with images of African women that were purely anthropological--bright displays of exotica where the deeper personhood seemed tucked away. Or they were chronicles of war and poverty--""poverty porn."" But now, curator Catherine E. McKinley draws on her extensive collection of historical and contemporary photos to present a visual history spanning a hundred-year arc (1870-1970) of what is among the earliest photography on the continent. These images tell a different story of African women: how deeply cosmopolitan and modern they are in their style; how they were able to reclaim the tools of the colonial oppression that threatened their selfhood and livelihoods. Featuring works by celebrated African masters, African studios of local legend, and anonymous artists, The African Lookbook captures the dignity, playfulness, austerity, grandeur, and fantasy-making of African women across centuries. McKinley also features photos by Europeans--most starkly, striking nudes--revealing the relationships between white men and the Black female sitters where, at best, a grave power imbalance lies. It's a bittersweet truth that when there is exploitation there can also be profound resistance expressed in unexpected ways--even if it's only in gazing back.

Peters, a scholar without peer in the comparative study of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, revisits his pioneering work after twenty-five years. Peters has rethought and thoroughly rewritten his classic The Children of Abraham for a new generation of readers-at a time when the understanding of these three religious traditions has taken on a new and critical urgency. He began writing about all three faiths in the 1970s, long before it was fashionable to treat Islam in the context of Judaism and Christianity, or to align all three for a family portrait. In this updated edition, he lays out the similarities and differences of the three religious siblings with great clarity and succinctness and with that same remarkable objectivity that is the hallmark of all the author's work.

Generation after generation, women have faced the devastating reality that Hollywood is a system built to keep them out. The films created by that system influence everything from our worldviews to our brain chemistry. When women's voices are excluded from the medium, the impact on society is immense. Actor, screenwriter, and award-winning independent filmmaker Naomi McDougall Jones takes us inside the cutthroat, scandal-laden film industry, where only 5% of top studio films are directed by women and less than 20% of leading characters in mainstream films are female. Jones calls on all of us to act radically to build a different kind of future for cinema--not only for the women being actively hurt inside the industry but for those outside it, whose lives, purchasing decisions, and sense of selves are shaped by the stories told. Informed by the journey of her own career; by interviews with others throughout the film industry; and by cold, hard data, Jones deconstructs the casual, commonplace sexism rampant in Hollywood that has kept women out of key roles for decades. Next, she shows us the growing women-driven revolution in filmmaking--sparked by streaming services, crumbling distribution models, direct-to-audience access via innovative online platforms, and outside advocacy groups--which has enabled women to build careers outside the traditional studio system. Finally, she makes a business case for financing and producing films by female filmmakers.",155.0,229.0,30.0,2,9780807033456,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/8070/9780807033456.jpg,807033456,9780807033456,en,2020-02-04,4.43,68,The Wrong Kind of Women : Inside Our Revolution to Dismantle the Gods of Hollywood,567.0

What drives the company that keeps creating and improving award-winning and bestselling models like the Civic, Accord, Odyssey, CR-V, and Pilot? According to Jeffrey Rothfeder, what truly distinguishes Honda from its competitors, especially archrival Toyota, is a deep commitment to a set of unorthodox management tenets. The Honda Way, as insiders call it, is notable for decentralization over corporate control, simplicity over complexity, experimentation over Six Sigma-driven efficiency, and unyielding cynicism toward the status quo and whatever is assumed to be the truth. Those are just a few of the ideas that the company's colorful founder Soichiro Honda embedded in the DNA of his start-up sixty-five years ago. As the first journalist allowed behind Honda's infamously private doors, Rothfeder interviewed dozens of executives, engineers, and frontline employees about Honda's management practices and global strategy.

We are all worried about wasting time. Especially in the West, we have created a frenzied lifestyle in which the twenty--four hours of each day are carved up, dissected, and reduced down to ten minute units of efficiency. We take our iPhones and laptops with us on vacation. We check email at restaurants or our brokerage accounts while walking in the park. When the school day ends, our children are overloaded with ""extras."" Our university curricula are so crammed our young people don't have time to reflect on the material they are supposed to be learning. Yet in the face of our time-driven existence, a great deal of evidence suggests there is great value in ""wasting time,"" of letting the mind lie fallow for some periods, of letting minutes and even hours go by without scheduled activities or intended tasks. Gustav Mahler routinely took three or four--hour walks after lunch, stopping to jot down ideas in his notebook. Carl Jung did his most creative thinking and writing when he visited his country house. In his 1949 autobiography, Albert Einstein described how his thinking involved letting his mind roam over many possibilities and making connections between concepts that were previously unconnected. With In Praise of Wasting Time, Professor Alan Lightman documents the rush and heave of the modern world, suggests the technological and cultural origins of our time--driven lives, and examines the many values of ""wasting time""--for replenishing the mind, for creative thought, and for finding and solidifying the inner self.

Then his wife, Mirax, vanishes on a covert mission for the New Republic, and Corran vows to find her.

Using his Corellian undercover experience, he must infiltrate, sabotage, and destroy a ruthless organization in order to find his wife.

Raphael Cushnir's own experience has taught him that we often close ourselves to love-that life's challenges, losses, and disappointments can shut us down emotionally and physically, leaving us stagnant in our work and relationships, and feeling empty and alone. Setting Your Heart on Fire presents his invigorating, step-by-step process for reopening and reawakening your heart and spirit, and for learning to use this ever-present love to blaze through any obstacle you may face. The Seven Invitations in this book will guide you through a courageous assessment of your choices, emotions, behaviors, and beliefs, revolutionizing your approach to stress and adversity, and revealing a brand new way of thinking and being. In accepting the Invitations, you will learn how to let go of harmful thoughts and heal deeply rooted emotional wounds. You will begin to open yourself to love's creativity and wisdom, struggling less yet achieving more. You will discover how to infuse everyday experiences with a breathtaking sense of joy and wonder. And your relationships - with family, friends, co-workers and romantic partners - will become a vehicle for profound and thrilling change. Each Invitation provides practical, easy-to-grasp examples that allow you to put its teachings immediately into practice. Over time, you will learn to access love in even the most difficult situations, unlocking the door to a fearless, authentic life. When your heart is on fire, the whole world is transformed by its light.",140.0,209.0,16.0,1,9780767913850,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/7679/9780767913850.jpg,076791385X,9780767913850,en,2004-04-13,3.84,32,Setting Your Heart on Fire : Seven Invitations to Liberate Your Life,322.0

And what role does God play in these stories? Does reconciliation make any sense apart from the biblical story of redemption? Secular models of peacemaking are insufficient. And the church has not always fulfilled its call to be agents of reconciliation in the world. In Reconciling All Things Emmanuel Katongole and Chris Rice, codirectors of the Center for Reconciliation at Duke Divinity School, cast a comprehensive vision for reconciliation that is biblical, transformative, holistic and global. They draw on the resources of the Christian story, including their own individual experiences in Uganda and Mississippi, to bring solid, theological reflection to bear on the work of reconciling individuals, groups and societies. They recover distinctively Christian practices that will help the church be both a sign and an agent of God's reconciling love in the fragmented world of the twenty-first century.

Padraic Kenney argues that the postwar takeover was also a social revolution, in which workers expressed their hopes for dramatic social change and influenced the evolution-and eventual downfall-of the communist regime.Kenney compares Loedz, Poland's largest manufacturing center, and Wroclaw, a city rebuilt as Polish upon the ruins of wartime destruction. His account of dramatic strikes in the textile mills of Loedz shows how workers resisted the communist party's encroachment on factory terrain and its infringements of worker dignity. The contrasting absence of labor conflict among migrants in the frontier city of Wroclaw holds important clues to the nature of stalinism in Poland: communist power was strongest where workers lacked organizational ties or cultural roots. In the collective reaction of workers in Loedz and the individualism of those in Wroclaw, Kenney locates the beginnings of the end of the communist regime. Losing the battle for worker identity, the communists placed their hopes in labor competition, which ultimately left the regime hostage to a resistant work force and an overextended economy incapable of reform.",152.0,229.0,25.0,1,9780801477935,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/8014/9780801477935.jpg,080147793X,9780801477935,en,2012-08-01,4.0,21,"Rebuilding Poland : Workers and Communists, 1945-1950",28.0

Call Sign Chaos is the account of Jim Mattis's storied career, from wide-ranging leadership roles in three wars to ultimately commanding a quarter of a million troops across the Middle East. Along the way, Mattis recounts his foundational experiences as a leader, extracting the lessons he has learned about the nature of warfighting and peacemaking, the importance of allies, and the strategic dilemmas--and short-sighted thinking--now facing our nation. He makes it clear why America must return to a strategic footing so as not to continue winning battles but fighting inconclusive wars. Mattis divides his book into three parts: direct leadership, executive leadership, and strategic leadership. In the first part, Mattis recalls his early experiences leading Marines into battle, when he knew his troops as well as his own brothers. In the second part, he explores what it means to command thousands of troops and how to adapt your leadership style to ensure your intent is understood by your most junior troops so that they can own their mission. In the third part, Mattis describes the challenges and techniques of leadership at the strategic level, where military leaders reconcile war's grim realities with political leaders' human aspirations, where complexity reigns and the consequences of imprudence are severe, even catastrophic.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1,9780812986631,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/8129/9780812986631.jpg,812986636,9780812986631,en,2021-06-16,4.35,6188,Call Sign Chaos : Learning to Lead,362.87

Although these policies represent some progress, women and minorities remain underrepresented within the workplace as a whole and even more so when you look at high-level positions. They also tend to be less well paid. How is it that discrimination remains so prevalent in the American workplace despite the widespread adoption of policies designed to prevent it? One reason for the limited success of antidiscrimination policies, argues Lauren B. Edelman, is that the law regulating companies is broad and ambiguous, and managers therefore play a critical role in shaping what it means in daily practice. Often, what results are policies and procedures that are largely symbolic and fail to dispel long-standing patterns of discrimination. Even more troubling, these meanings of the law that evolve within companies tend to eventually make their way back into the legal domain, inconspicuously influencing lawyers for both plaintiffs and defendants and even judges.",166.0,232.0,19.0,1,9780226400761,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/2264/9780226400761.jpg,022640076X,9780226400761,en,2017-01-24,4.67,3,"Working Law : Courts, Corporations, and Symbolic Civil Rights",564.0

Simply stated, samadhi is the free flow of vital energy within the body and between the body and the universe. Moving effortlessly across traditions and techniques, Sayama discovers that sages throughout history--Greek philosophers, German mystics, Indian seers, and our own Albert Einstein among others--have taught that this experience of transcendental oneness lies at the heart of full self-realization. The first part of the book studies self-realization in Zen Buddhism. The author pinpoints its essence in Buddha's enlightenment. The development of Zen is then traced, continuing down to living masters who in very recent times have transplanted their lineages from Japan to the United States. Sayama notes that we must choose as masters those to whom the authentic teaching has been transmitted through generations, and he examines in loving detail the sometimes strange and astonishing behaviors of those whose very presence communicates the state of samadhi. The second part of the book presents Zen therapy, a way of self-development emphasizing the cultivation of samadhi through psychophysical training. Sayama compares the effects of Rolfing, Feldenkrais, and Zen therapy on the human body and mind. He includes easy-to-follow directions for creating the inner state he describes.

But with its nearly endless possibilities and challenges, it is more than just another game; it is a way of life for tens of millions of players throughout the world. Embodying four thousand years of Oriental thought and culture, go is the oldest game in the world still played in its original form. Go is the kind of game that one can learn in a day--and spend a lifetime perfecting. It is more art than science: in order to surround and capture the opponent's territory, one needs intuition, flexibility, and acute perception combined with a sharp analytical mind. Each player is a partner in an exercise of coexistence; each player needs the other for self-enlightenment and for enjoyment. But then, too, go is a game whose strategy has been compared to the tactics of guerilla warfare. Go can be all things to all people; it is simple, elegant, and unexpectedly beautiful. This book contains an introduction; a brief example game; a clear, leisurely explanation of the rules; and illustrations of the simplest techniques of good play and of some easy and some more difficult problems the player will encounter.

Its leaders declined to make a pronouncement on war against infidels, but Trent's most glaring and ironic silence was on the authority of the papacy itself. The popes, who reigned as Italian monarchs while serving as pastors, did everything in their power to keep papal reform out of the council's hands--and their power was considerable.

One hundred thousand years ago. In the wake of the apparent self-destruction of the alien Forerunner empire, two humans--Chakas and Riser--are like flotsam washed up on very strange shores indeed. Captured by the Forerunner known as the Master Builder and then misplaced during a furious battle in space, Chakas and Riser now find themselves on an inverted world, where horizons rise into the sky and humans of all kinds are trapped in a perilous cycle of horror and neglect. They have become both research animals and strategic pawns in a cosmic game whose madness knows no end--a game of ancient vengeance between the powers who seeded the galaxy with life, and the Forerunners who expect to inherit their sacred Mantle of Responsibility to all living things. In the company of a young girl and an old man, Chakas begins an epic journey across a lost and damaged Halo ringworld in search of a way home, an explanation for the warrior spirits rising up within, and the reason for the Forerunner Librarian's tampering with human destiny. Their travels will take them into the domain of a powerful and monstrous intelligence--known as ""the Captive"" by Forerunners, and ""the Primordial"" by ancient human warriors, this being may not only control the fate of Chakas, Riser, and the rest of humanity, but of all sentient life across the galaxy...",140.0,211.0,28.0,1,9781982111779,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/9821/9781982111779.jpg,1982111771,9781982111779,en,2019-03-26,3.75,4008,"Halo: Primordium, Volume 9 : Book Two of the Forerunner Saga",295.0

Drawing inspiration from the spiritual life of past millennia, they strive to return to the pre-Christian roots of their ancestors. Since Christianity dominates the spiritual discourse in Ukraine, Pagans are marginalized, and their ideas are perceived as radical. In The Return of Ancestral Gods, Mariya Lesiv explores Pagan beliefs and practices in Ukraine and amongst the North American Ukrainian diaspora. Drawing on intensive fieldwork, archival documents, and published sources not available in English, she allows the voices of Pagans to be heard. Paganism in Slavic countries is heavily charged with ethno-nationalist politics, and previous scholarship has mainly focused on this aspect. Lesiv finds it important to consider not only how Paganism is preached but also the way that it is understood on a private level. She shows that many Ukrainians embrace Paganism because of its aesthetic aspects rather than its associated politics and discusses the role that aesthetics may play in the further development of Ukrainian Paganism.",152.0,229.0,25.4,2,9780773542624,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/7735/9780773542624.jpg,773542620,9780773542624,en,2013-10-01,3.7,10,The Return of Ancestral Gods: Volume 2 : Modern Ukrainian Paganism as an Alternative Vision for a Nation,498.95

While scores of books exist about the man and his teaching methods, few devote significant coverage to ""the Gurdjieff Movements."" These dozens of precise and mostly asymmetrical gestures, arranged into detailed choreographies for groups of practitioners, were designed by Gurdjieff himself. They are sometimes practiced accompanied by a haunting and highly-rhythmic piano music-developed by the master, with the assistance of Thomas de Hartmann, a distinguished professional composer and one of his earliest students. This new book by author Wim van Dullemen reconsiders the eminent role of this vital yet often neglected component in the transmission of Gurdjieff's legacy. Dullemen, whose first Movements' teacher received her instruction from Gurdjieff himself, is in a unique position to offer background, theory and first-hand experience about this subject. He is a professional musician and a long-time practitioner of the Gurdjieff work who trained in these Movements and served as a master accompanist for the practice for over thirty years. No book can ""teach"" the Movements, the author candidly admits, since the cosmology they rest within can only be learned in an experiential context from a teacher who has incorporated them at a level far beyond ordinary familiarity. The author makes no such attempt to detail them within the pages of his book. Far from an instruction manual, The Gurdjieff Movements, A Communication of Ancient Wisdom, offers invaluable insight into and greater understanding of the whys and wherefores of this third arm of the vast teaching that comprises Gurdjieff's complete communication: his books, his oral teachings, and finally his Movements. Dullemen's treatment will appeal to many, including scholars, new or long-time students of the Gurdjieff tradition, musicians, purveyors of sacred music and dance, and the general public desiring an insider's view to a practice based in ancient wisdom. The author has skillfully integrated: * autobiographical descriptions of the master Gurdjieff and others * interviews with direct pupils of Gurdjieff * diligent research within a wide range of firsthand sources * descriptions of the scientific, cultural and social climate during Gurdjieff's time, and the possible relation between these and his teaching.

W. F. Hegel, Osama bin Laden, Sigmund Freud, Frantz Fanon, Thomas Hobbes, and Pierre Bourdieu. The volume proceeds from the editors' contention that violence is always historically contingent; it must be contextualized to be understood. They argue that violence is a process rather than a discrete product. It is intrinsic to the human condition, an inescapable fact of life that can be channeled and reckoned with but never completely suppressed. Above all, they seek to illuminate the relationship between action and knowledge about violence, and to examine how one might speak about violence without replicating or perpetuating it.On Violence is divided into five sections. Underscoring the connection between violence and economic world orders, the first section explores the dialectical relationship between domination and subordination. The second section brings together pieces by political actors who spoke about the tension between violence and nonviolence-Gandhi, Hitler, and Malcolm X-and by critics who have commented on that tension. The third grouping examines institutional faces of violence-familial, legal, and religious-while the fourth reflects on state violence. With a focus on issues of representation, the final section includes pieces on the relationship between violence and art, stories, and the media. The editors' introduction to each section highlights the significant theoretical points raised and the interconnections between the essays.

Linguistic creativity is central to the law, with literary modes such as narrative and metaphor infiltrating legal texts. Equally, legal norms of good and bad conduct, of identity and human responsibility, are reflected or subverted in literature's engagement with questions of law and justice. Law seeks to regulate creative expression, while literary texts critique and sometimes openly resist the law. Kieran Dolin introduces this interdisciplinary field, focusing on the many ways that law and literature have addressed and engaged with each other. He charts the history of the shifting relations between the two disciplines, from the open affiliation between literature and law in the sixteenth-century Inns of Court to the less visible links of contemporary culture.

Lehner reintroduces Christians to the true God--not the polite, easygoing, divine therapist who doesn't ask much of us, but the Almighty God who is unpredictable, awe-inspiring, and demands our entire lives. Stripping away the niceties with a sling blade, Lehner shows that God is more strange and beautiful than we imagine, and wants to know and transform us in the most intimate way.  With his iconoclastic new book God Is Not Nice, Lehner, one of the most promising young Catholic theologians in America, challenges the God of popular culture and many of our churches and reintroduces the God of the Bible and traditional Christianity. As Lehner writes in the book's introduction, ""We all need the vaccine of the true transforming and mysterious character of God: The God who shows up in burning bushes, speaks through donkeys, drives demons into pigs, throws Saul from his horse, and appears to St. Francis. It's only this God who has the power to challenge us, change us, and make our lives dangerous. He sweeps us into a great adventure that will make us into different people.""  This book is not safe. It may startle and annoy many people--including those who purport to teach and preach the Gospel, but are missing it, according to Lehner. God Is Not Nice intends to overthrow all of our popular misconceptions about God, inviting us to ask deeper questions about the nature of our lives and our relationship with him.

Consequently, they will turn with excitement to this important new book which is a stunning attempt by two knowledgeable, persevering psychotherapists to present their understanding and sound therapeutic approach to these difficult and challenging patients. The authors argue that the treatment of choice is clearly psychotherapy and that such treatment can be successful and as long lasting for schizophrenic patients as it is for neurotic patients, but the journey may be longer and it may take more time to traverse.The task of therapy is to untangle the past from the present to make the future conceivable. The volume provides a thorough historical overview of the theoretical and clinical approaches to the problem of schizophrenia, including the views of leading contemporary clinicians on the topic. In general, the major clinical controversies have been regarded as issues of whether to focus on past, present or future; reality or fantasy; affects; exploration or relationship; whether the therapist should be active or passive; and how to handle regression. The authors argue that these are the wrong issues. They say that the task of therapy is to untangle the past from the present to make the future conceivable. Reality and fantasy are intertwined and must both be dealt with. Affects are central to all therapy, and emphasis on anger, despair, loneliness, terror, and shame are all necessary, as is the clarification of affect, and the acceptance of positive affect. Activity versus passivity is again in the wrong question; the right one is what action is helpful, when it is helpful, and when is not doing anything helpful? Regression is inevitable; should one accept it fully or try to limit it?

They offer a roadmap for those looking for a way forward from an American life marked by divisive conversations.  In a world with widespread political upheaval, a deep wellspring of civic engagement and collective action is emerging. America is finding that our cultural and political dialogue is spiking over everything from racial and social justice to fighting the ever-widening income gap, to climate change--even how we might best collaborate as active citizens to heal our democracy.  Timely, inspiring, and highly charged, The Gardens of Democracy is a much-needed call to action for citizens to embrace their roles in a democratic society. To model positivity and good citizenship, plus ensure liberty and justice for all, we must achieve compromise by reaching across the aisle and putting the power to execute programs back in the hands of individuals, not big government.  We must redefine how we view prosperity in order to move from a dog-eat-dog mentality that perpetuates the top 1% to a communal and inclusive movement that illustrates that we're all better off when we're all better off.

In 2011, Christine Toomey met an unforgettable group of Tibetan Buddhist nuns. After hearing their stories--of prison, extreme hardship, and ultimately fleeing across the Himalayas into exile--she resolved to learn more about the private, courageous women of Buddhism: who they are, their experience of suffering, what motivates them to seek enlightenment, and what stands in their way. Toomey's quest took on even greater urgency with the sudden deaths of her father and then her mother, and her own search for healing wisdom in the aftermath of loss. In Search of Buddha's Daughters introduces us to women from around the world--Nepal, India, Burma, and Japan, as well as the US, the UK, and France--who have come to the ordained life from every faith and career: a former policewoman, a princess, a Bollywood star, and a concert violinist. Toomey meets a Harvard graduate who sometimes breaks into hip-hop moves after meditating, a Japanese nun who has written bestselling erotica, and a Nepalese order of nuns who practice kung fu for spiritual and physical empowerment.  Through insightful conversations with over thirty women, Toomey investigates Buddhism as an antidote to the problems of life in the twenty-first century, and considers the status of women today--worldwide, and within one of our oldest wisdom traditions. ""In a world numbed by the amount of attention paid to violence, terrorism, and political and religious power struggles,"" she writes, ""I find it profoundly refreshing to come across women whose lives are dedicated to nurturing the opposite.""",145.0,211.0,33.0,2,9781615193264,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/6151/9781615193264.jpg,161519326X,9781615193264,en,2016-03-22,4.09,195,In Search of Buddha's Daughters : A Modern Journey Down Ancient Roads,544.0

Pitts-Taylor is interested in how the brain interacts with and is impacted by social structures, especially in regard to race, class, gender, sexuality, and disability, as well as how those social structures shape neuroscientific knowledge. Pointing out that some brain scientists have not fully abandoned reductionist or determinist explanations of neurobiology, Pitts-Taylor moves beyond debates over nature and nurture to address the politics of plastic, biosocial brains. She highlights the potential of research into poverty's effects on the brain to reinforce certain notions of poor subjects and to justify particular forms of governance, while her queer critique of kinship research demonstrates the limitations of hypotheses based on heteronormative assumptions. In her exploration of the embodied mind and the ""embrained"" body, Pitts-Taylor highlights the inextricability of nature and culture and shows why using feminist and queer thought is essential to understanding the biosociality of the brain.",152.0,229.0,12.7,1,9780822361268,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/8223/9780822361268.jpg,822361264,9780822361268,en,2016-03-16,4.0,17,The Brain's Body : Neuroscience and Corporeal Politics,272.0

We also meet some new characters, such as Stephanie Widgeon, who only seems to have one thing to say, ever. . . and who knows, we might even find out why Leonard Thynn borrowed Adrian's cat all those years ago.And finally - what is a banner ripping seminar?",137.0,203.0,12.0,1,9780310269137,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/mid/9780/3102/9780310269137.jpg,031026913X,9780310269137,en,2005-09-19,4.32,321,"The Sacred Diary of Adrian Plass, Christian Speaker, Aged 45 3/4",190.0

But lately, with the limited space available for most people, especially in the cities, bonsai has really become quite a craze all over the world. The beauty of a bonsai tree is that it can be placed anywhere in your house, in your living room or in your porch. It doesn't take much space. Aesthetically, it looks great and goes with any kind of home décor. It can be grown in any container and placed anywhere to add that natural touch to the place. But does it require no care? That's not true because just like your regular trees, a bonsai also requires proper care, fertilization and watering. In fact, if you take good care of your miniature tree, it can survive for hundreds of years! Most people also think that only special varieties can be a bonsai tree. That's also not true.

SOON TO BE A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE  ""[Picoult] offers a thought-provoking examination of racism in America today, both overt and subtle. Her many readers will find much to discuss in the pages of this topical, moving book.""--Booklist (starred review)  Ruth Jefferson is a labor and delivery nurse at a Connecticut hospital with more than twenty years' experience. During her shift, Ruth begins a routine checkup on a newborn, only to be told a few minutes later that she's been reassigned to another patient. The parents are white supremacists and don't want Ruth, who is African American, to touch their child. The hospital complies with their request, but the next day, the baby goes into cardiac distress while Ruth is alone in the nursery. Does she obey orders or does she intervene?  Ruth hesitates before performing CPR and, as a result, is charged with a serious crime. Kennedy McQuarrie, a white public defender, takes her case but gives unexpected advice: Kennedy insists that mentioning race in the courtroom is not a winning strategy. Conflicted by Kennedy's counsel, Ruth tries to keep life as normal as possible for her family--especially her teenage son--as the case becomes a media sensation. As the trial moves forward, Ruth and Kennedy must gain each other's trust, and come to see that what they've been taught their whole lives about others--and themselves--might be wrong.  With incredible empathy, intelligence, and candor, Jodi Picoult tackles race, privilege, prejudice, justice, and compassion--and doesn't offer easy answers. Small Great Things is a remarkable achievement from a writer at the top of her game.

His early work had been accomplished, but belonged tonally to the impressionistic, feeling-centered world of a late-nineteenth-century aesthetic. Paris was to change everything. Rilke's interest in Rodin deepened and his enthusiasm for the sculptor's art of living surfaces set the course for his own pursuit of an objective ideal. What was new about Rilke's New Poems, published in two independent volumes in 1907 and 1908, is a compression of statement and a movement away from expression and toward making realities. Poems such as The Panther and Archaic Torso of Apollo are among the most successful and famous results of Rilke's impulse. This selection from both books unites the companion volumes in a torrent of brilliant work intoxicated with the materiality of the world.

It draws on results from the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction, and on experience with sustainable development between the two Earth Summits, in Rio de Janeiro and Johannesburg. It is intended for practitioners, as well as for policy-makers and researchers, and thus covers both general and technical aspects of environmental health. In Part I of this volume, a conceptual framework is presented for understanding environmental health issues in the context of disaster management. The framework covers the entire disaster-management cycle, from preparedness and warning, to recovery and prevention. Guidelines are also suggested for planning and reducing the effects of extreme events on public health, and practical guidance is given in organizational and logistical matters. Throughout, the need for flexibility and innovation at the local level is emphasized, combined with solid advance planning. There is also a focus on the vulnerability of populations during an emergency or disaster, with the implication that such people have capacities and local knowledge that should be integrated into efforts to secure both environment and development against extreme events. The creative potential of balancing ""top-down"" and ""bottom-up"" approaches is emphasized in chapters on health promotion and community participation, and on human resources. Part II of this book is a detailed compendium of best practices and strategies for risk reduction and response in the fields of: - Shelter and emergency settlements; - Water supply; - Sanitation; - Food safety; - Vector and pest control; - Control of communicable diseases and prevention of epidemics; - Chemical incidents; - Radiation emergencies; - Mortuary service and handling of the dead; - Health promotion and community participation; and - Human resources. This book will be useful in planning for, responding to, and recovering from the movements of displaced persons and refugees in humanitarian crises, as well as the floods, storms, earthquakes and other extreme events that could confront health workers in the first decade of the 21st century.

He recruits many famous Westerners for his quest. By the time the group arrives to the edge of Kansas, Winnetou, the chief of the Apache, joins them, and fights alongside Old Firehand. To reach the Silver Lake they have to go to Colorado where the Ute tribes are on the warpath. This is when Old Shatterhand and his friends appear, and after four duels for life or death, they unite with Old Firehand's group. They all go to the Silver Lake together.

In THE FOOD AND WINE OF FRANCE, the influential food writer Edward Behr investigates French cuisine and what it means, in encounters from Champagne to Provence. He tells the stories of French artisans and chefs who continue to work at the highest level. Many people in and out of France have noted for a long time the slow retreat of French cuisine, concerned that it is losing its important place in the country's culture and in the world culture of food. And yet, as Behr writes, good French food remains very, very delicious. No cuisine is better. The sensuousness is overt. French cooking is generous, both obvious and subtle, simple and complex, rustic and utterly refined. A lot of recent inventive food by comparison is wildly abstract and austere. In the tradition of great food writers, Edward Behr seeks out the best of French food and wine. He shows not only that it is as relevant as ever, but he also challenges us to see that it might become the world's next cutting edge cuisine. France remains the greatest country for bread, cheese, and wine, and its culinary techniques are the foundation of the training of nearly every serious Western cook and some beyond. Behr talks with chefs and goes to see top artisanal producers in order to understand what ""the best"" means for them, the nature of traditional methods, how to enjoy the foods, and what the optimal pairings are. As he searches for the very best in French food and wine, he introduces a host of important, memorable people. THE FOOD AND WINE OF FRANCE is a remarkable journey of discovery. It is also an investigation into why classical French food is so extraordinarily delicious--and why it will endure.",161.0,243.0,27.94,2,9781594204524,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/5942/9781594204524.jpg,1594204527,9781594204524,en,2016-07-28,3.72,120,The Food And Wine Of France : Eating & Drinking from Champagne to Provence,557.0

Araghi's skillful combination of revolutionary politics and magical realism will please fans of Alejo Carpentier.--Publishers Weekly A sweeping, multigenerational epic, this stunning debut heralds the arrival of a unique new literary voice. As a child living in his family's apple orchard, Ahmad Torkash-Vand treasures his great-great-great-great grandfather's every mesmerizing word. On the day of his father's death, Ahmad listens closely as the seemingly immortal elder tells him the tale of a centuries-old family curse . . . and the boy's own fated role in the story.

Why have so many generations of reformers failed to improve the educational system, and, indeed, caused it to degenerate further and further into an ever declining level of mediocrity?In this radical and scholarly monograph, out of print for two decades and restored according to the author's original, Murray N. Rothbard identifies the crucial feature of our educational system that dooms it to fail: at every level, from financing to attendance, the system relies on compulsion instead of voluntary consent.Certain consequences follow. The curriculum is politicized to reflect the ideological priorities of the regime in power. Standards are continually dumbed down to accommodate the least common denominator. The brightest children are not permitted to achieve their potential, the special- needs of individual children are neglected, and the mid-level learners become little more than cogs in a machine. The teachers themselves are hamstrung by a political apparatus that watches their every move.Rothbard explores the history of compulsory schooling to show that none of this is accident. The state has long used compulsory schooling, backed by egalitarian ideology, as a means of citizen control. In contrast, a market-based system of schools would adhere to a purely voluntary ethic, financed with private funds, and administered entirely by private enterprise.An interesting feature of this book is its promotion of individual, or home, schooling, long before the current popularity of the practice.As Kevin Ryan of Boston University points out in the introduction, if education reform is ever to bring about fundamental change, it will have to begin with a complete rethinking of public schooling that Rothbard offers here.",216.0,280.0,4.0,1,9781479265046,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/4792/9781479265046.jpg,1479265047,9781479265046,en,1999-01-01,4.11,414,Education : Free & Compulsory (Large Print Edition),177.0

The Familiar (Volume 1) ranges from Mexico to Southeast Asia, from Venice, Italy, to Venice, California, with nine lives hanging in the balance, each called upon to make a terrifying choice. They include a therapist-in-training grappling with daughters as demanding as her patients; an ambitious East L.A. gang member contracted for violence; two scientists in Marfa, Texas, on the run from an organization powerful beyond imagining; plus a recovering addict in Singapore summoned at midnight by a desperate billionaire; and a programmer near Silicon Beach whose game engine might unleash consequences far exceeding the entertainment he intends. At the very heart, though, is a twelve-year-old girl named Xanther who one rainy day in May sets out with her father to get a dog, only to end up trying to save a creature as fragile as it is dangerous . . . which will change not only her life and the lives of those she has yet to encounter, but this world, too--or at least the world we think we know and the future we take for granted.

At least two races of man have invaded Agaveland during the last ten to fifteen thousand years, where, with the help of agaves, they contrived several successive civilizations. The region of greatest use development is Mesoamerica. Here the great genetic diversity in a genus rich in use potential came into the hands of several peoples who developed the main agricultural center of the Americas.

From the pressing need to avoid ""losing face"" to the urge to scapegoat and blame, from the desire to exclude those who are different to the horrors of ethnic cleansing, from the obsession with body image to the abiding terrors of the abused, shame is a universal phenomenon. It transcends boundaries of time and is evident in diverse cultures across the world. It is, furthermore, found throughout the pages of Scripture, yet in modern theology shame is conspicuous by its absence. This book attempts to redress the balance by exploring the theology of shame, from its inception in the garden of Eden, to the final triumph over shame on the cross. Restoring the Shamed will offer readers the opportunity to think theologically about one of the most urgent, yet strangely secret, issues of contemporary society. Endorsements: ""Robin Stockitt's Restoring the Shamed is a rediscovery of a neglected dimension in the biblical witnesses, making it relevant for today's most painful human experiences. It offers an abundance of pastoral insights, creative theological explorations, and imaginative suggestions for ecclesial practice. Beginning with . . . the absence of a theology of shame in modern theology, the book becomes a courageous and rewarding journey of theological discovery."" -Christoph Schwobel Chair in Systematic Theology University of Tubingen ""This is a passionate book, in all the right senses . . . Reading it will not only help to restore the shamed; it will likely restore a godly passion-and few things are more sorely needed in theology today."" -Jeremy S. Begbie Thomas A. Langford Research Professor Duke Divinity School ""Robin Stockitt has written a powerful and persuasive book that shows the centrality of shame in human experience and in the biblical message. It is the most readable and theologically astute account of Christ's ministry to the shamed that is available today. This warmly pastoral book contains rich resources to deal with crippling experiences such as being treated as unworthy or unwanted."" -Robert Jewett Visiting Professor of New Testament University of Heidelberg Author Biography: Robin Stockitt is the minister of the Anglican Church in Freiburg, Germany. He is the author of Open to the Spirit: Ignatius of Loyola and John Wimber in Dialogue (2000) and Imagination and the Playfulness of God: The Theological Implications of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's Definition of the Human Imagination (2011).",152.0,229.0,10.0,1,9781610973151,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/6109/9781610973151.jpg,1610973151,9781610973151,en,2012-02-21,4.48,21,Restoring the Shamed : Towards a Theology of Shame,276.0

Trash Market brings together six of Tsuge's compelling, character-driven stories about life in post-World War II Japan. Trash Market and Gently Goes the Night touch on key topics for Tsuge: the charming lowlifes of the Tokyo slums and the WWII veterans who found themselves unable to forget the war. Song of Showa is an autobiographical piece about growing up in a Tokyo slum during the Occupation of Japan with an abusive grandfather and an ailing father, and finding brightness in the joyful people of the neighbourhood. Trash Market blurs the lines between fiction and reportage; it's a moving testament to the grittiness of life in Tokyo during the post-war years.  Trash Market features an essay from the collection's editor and translator Ryan Holmberg, who is a specialist in Japanese art history.

Here is one of her classic novels, an exquisite tale of longtime friends who have seen it all--and suddenly see each other in a whole new light. Ever since losing her husband, Cyn McCall has counted on his business partner, Worth Lansing. Though a confirmed bachelor, Worth nonetheless proves himself to be a dependable friend and a father figure to her son. He makes her laugh, and she teases him about his many romantic entanglements. But falling for a man who can't settle down is the furthest thing from her mind--until an innocent gesture changes everything. When Worth invites Cyn to a getaway weekend in Acapulco, he doesn't expect to be sharing a room. And he certainly doesn't intend for them to wind up in bed together.

He then offers a model of analysis that draws on Lacan's theoretical insights into the structure of subjectivity and the psychological functions of discourse, asserting that the use of this model can promote collective psychological change. While cultural criticism has generally focused on texts, Bracher instead analyzes audiences' actual responses-to a variety of discourses from ""high"" as well as popular culture: the political speeches of Ronald Reagan and Jesse Jackson, anti-abortion propaganda, pornography, Keats's ""To Autumn,"" and Conrad's Heart of Darkness. Through analyzing these responses, Bracher is able to uncover the unconscious identifications and fantasies of the respondents-an intervention that, he argues, has the potential for altering subjectivity. In his view, such a method of cultural criticism is both unusually powerful and ethnically defensible, since instead of attacking or upholding a group's values, it reveals the psychological conflicts manifest in responses to particular texts.Lacan, Discourse, and Social Change will be essential reading for students as well as specialists in such fields as cultural criticism, feminist theory, literary theory, psychoanalytic criticism, reader-response criticism, reader-response criticism, and Lacanian theory.",152.0,229.0,13.0,1,9780801480638,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/8014/9780801480638.jpg,801480639,9780801480638,en,2000-09-01,3.88,17,"Lacan, Discourse, and Social Change : A Psychoanalytic Cultural Criticism",317.51

The combined trauma and damage caused by the prescription drug resulted in severely limited vision in his injured eye. Unable to accept the result of this injury, he embarked on a mission to overcome it. As a result of the damage he sustained, he had the opportunity to interact with accomplished doctors in many prestigious universities and institutions. He participated in events and seminars that only doctors were invited to and engaged in all available rehabilitation. He researched and sought all information, studies, and associated work on vision impairment and restoration that he could get his hands on. One important observation of his journey was the adherence of most of the vision industry to the medical model of healing. This failed model takes a general approach to correcting vision problems by mitigating symptoms without offering any solution to the underlying disorder. One important discovery of this journey was the field of sequencing neurosensory and neuromuscular activities that are individually prescribed to develop, rehabilitate, and enhance visual skills and information processing. This field is also referred to as vision therapy. The author's journey resulted in the restoration of his vision. The restoration of the vision of others that he shared these concepts with motivated him to develop his own ""Vision Therapy System"" that he now shares with you in this book. About the Book: Vision Therapy: Exercise Your Eyes and Improve Your Eyesight examines vision therapy and the historic application of it to correct vision problems. How eyesight works and the key components of successful vision therapy programs are explained. The reader is taught the impact of additional factors that should be considered and addressed to improve eyesight including; correcting poor visual practices, computer vision syndrome, disease, medication, aging, diet and nutrition, hormonal cycling, physical exercise, and multiple methods of stress relief. The reader will learn how glasses and contacts are practically guaranteed to ruin your vision over time and how they can protect themselves. The book concludes with the author's Vision Therapy System, providing board certified vision therapy at a fraction of the cost. Simple explanations and multitude of treatment plans are contained for you to choose from to create your own personalized vision therapy program designed specifically for your needs. Printable eye charts are included for measuring your vision improvement progress. This book has been sold for over 10 years online and recently converted to Amazon kindle.

Decluttering. Discarding. Sooner or later, all of us are faced with things we no longer need or want. But when we drop our old clothes and other items off at a local donation center, where do they go? Sometimes across the country-or even halfway across the world-to people and places who find value in what we leave behind. In Secondhand, journalist Adam Minter takes us on an unexpected adventure into the often-hidden, multibillion-dollar industry of reuse: thrift stores in the American Southwest to vintage shops in Tokyo, flea markets in Southeast Asia to used-goods enterprises in Ghana, and more. Along the way, Minter meets the fascinating people who handle-and profit from-our rising tide of discarded stuff, and asks a pressing question: In a world that craves shiny and new, is there room for it all? Secondhand offers hopeful answers and hard truths. A history of the stuff we've used and a contemplation of why we keep buying more, it also reveals the marketing practices, design failures, and racial prejudices that push used items into landfills instead of new homes. Secondhand shows us that it doesn't have to be this way, and what really needs to change to build a sustainable future free of excess stuff. Minter is a superb storyteller . . .

Now, in his latest book, Speaking in Tongues, he focuses his theological spotlight on the biblical experience of 'speaking in other tongues as the Spirit gives utterance'. Menzies' thesis is that Jesus and the apostolic Church are models for the contemporary Church. This book is an engaging exposition of a thorny, if not actually contentious issue. It speaks to different readers in different ways. For example, it challenges those who oppose the doctrine and/or experience; it functions as a guide for those who may be confused or bewildered about the experience; and finally, it gives an apologetic foundation for those who are defending both the biblical doctrine and the contemporary experience. Menzies' latest book, Speaking in Tongues, serves the Church well, and is, indeed, a must read.' -Roger Stronstad, Scholar in Residence, Summit Pacific College, Abbotsford, BC, Canada. 'As always, Robert Menzies, one of Pentecostalism's leading scholars, provides careful exegesis, weighing various alternatives and coming to reasoned conclusions, offering fresh insights for all interpreters to consider. His passionate, pastoral concerns mixed with live observations, especially from our brothers and sisters in China, add further to this book's value. Even those who dissent from some of his conclusions should appreciate and learn from his magnificent literary explorations and intriguing proposals. This book should make us all the more grateful for the beautiful, Spirit-led gift of worship in tongues.' -Craig S. Keener, F. M. and Ada Thompson Professor of Biblical Studies, Asbury Theological Seminary. 'Robert Menzies makes a compelling case for the fact that speaking in tongues was well known to the original audiences of the New Testament and that the biblical texts written to them now speak to us as an open invitation to experience the Holy Spirit as they did. This book is sure to be a provocative read among lay people and pastors alike.' -Frank D.

Combining the irrepressible linguistic invention of Salman Rushdie and the satirical vision of George Saunders, Unnikrishnan presents twenty-eight linked stories that careen from construction workers who shapeshift into luggage and escape a labor camp, to a woman who stitches back together the bodies of those who've fallen from buildings in progress, to a man who grows ideal workers designed to live twelve years and then perish--until they don't, and found a rebel community in the desert. With this polyphony, Unnikrishnan brilliantly maps a new, unruly global English.

[27430],751370,[287],"PYGMALION is a play by George Bernard Shaw, named after a Greek mythological character. It was first presented on stage to the public in 1913. Professor of phonetics Henry Higgins makes a bet that he can train a bedraggled Cockney flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, to pass for a duchess at an ambassador's garden party by teaching her to assume a veneer of gentility, the most important element of which, he believes, is impeccable speech. The play is a sharp lampoon of the rigid British class system of the day and a commentary on women's independence. In ancient Greek mythology, Pygmalion fell in love with one of his sculptures, which then came to life. The general idea of that myth was a popular subject for Victorian era English playwrights, including one of Shaw's influences, W. S. Gilbert, who wrote a successful play based on the story called Pygmalion and Galatea first presented in 1871. Shaw would also have been familiar with the burlesque version, Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed. Shaw's play has been adapted numerous times, most notably as the musical My Fair Lady and the film of that name.

It is what makes us into the unique beings that we are. Star fashion designer Rebecca Moses has devoted herself to crafting chic garments for stylish women world-wide. Underpinning her years of innovative design has been a series of questions: What is style? How does it evolve? And what can we do to develop our own style? A Life of Style provides the answers. Consisting entirely of Moses's inventive watercolors, which incorporate witty words of wisdom distilled from personal experience, A Life of Style encourages readers to draw upon and develop their innate style--traditional or modern, conservative or radical--and especially to cultivate the confidence to express themselves. Rebecca Moses offers a style journey that is at once informative and imaginative. She persuades readers to listen to themselves and their instincts, to open their minds to new ways of thinking, and above all to search for inspiration. Once the style mind is engaged, she turns to fashion and beauty (""Don't forget: We wear our clothes--they don't wear us""), the home (""Creating a home is creating a world of your own""), and entertaining (""The best gift of all is the gift of relaxation and great pleasure""). Above all, says Moses, style is personal communication at its most profound, most ingenious, most original. Style is not skin deep. It is soul deep. It is our most significant form of expression. It is how we communicate who we are to the world around us.

Status in Los Angeles, like success in the ever-fascinating movie industry that sets it apart, is based on the creation of truly unique moments. A relentless celebration of personality fuels the city, creating a cult of the individual and driving the city's collective exaltation of talents and quirks. This collection of nineteen homes designed by Los Angeles-based architects and designers illustrates this exuberance and diversity. The homes showcased here in over 200 full-color images are in the hills and on the flats--they evoke Old Europe with antique or hand-crafted finishes, keep guests riveted to the moment with intensely rich details, or defer, with restrained palettes, to stunning views of the Pacific Ocean. They are of new construction by iconic figures such as Richard Meier & Partners, as well as classic homes such as a Spanish Revival by George H. Freuhling, a fanciful Storybook streamlined for contemporary life, and immaculately restored midcentury homes by Harwell Hamilton Harris and John Lautner.

Most readers of the book of Genesis in the past understood all humans descended from Adam and Eve, a couple specially created by God. These two teachings seem contradictory, but is that necessarily so? In the fractured conversation of human origins, can new insight guide us to solid ground in both science and theology? In The Genealogical Adam and Eve, S. Joshua Swamidass tests a scientific hypothesis: What if the traditional account is somehow true, with the origins of Adam and Eve taking place alongside evolution? Building on well-established but overlooked science, Swamidass explains how it's possible for Adam and Eve to be rightly identified as the ancestors of everyone. His analysis opens up new possibilities for understanding Adam and Eve, consistent both with current scientific consensus and with traditional readings of Scripture. These new possibilities open a conversation about what it means to be human.

Built as the ultimate American battleship and designed to engage the major units of the Japanese and German fleets, the class were commissioned in the closing stages of World War II, the beginning of half a century of service during which individual units saw action in the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Lebanese Civil War and finally the Gulf War. As such these vessels are symbolic of the primacy of US seapower during the Cold War, and the preservation of all four of these mighty vessels as museum ships is testament not only to their enduring fascination, but also to the immense technical, financial, military and political resources wielded by the United States during the second half of the twentieth century. This superb new book includes a general introduction providing the context and design history of the entire class; detailed and extensively illustrated information on specifications, equipment and modifications; and comprehensive coverage of the construction, career, operations and preservation of each unit. The author covers all the significant events in the life of each ship, including Missouri in Tokyo Bay, New Jersey off Vietnam and Lebanon, Wisconsin's collision with the destroyer Eaton, the Iowa turret explosion and many others. Lavishly illustrated with more than 600 photos (many in colour), 35 spectacular CG artworks and six maps, this beautifully produced work is the ultimate volume on the ultimate battleship class and a fitting souvenir of these four ships, now all preserved for posterity.

In her book Playing It by Heart, Beattie helps readers understand what drives them back into the grasp of controlling behavior and victimhood--and what it takes to pull themselves out, to return to the healing, faith, and maturity that come with a commitment to recovery. Personal essays, inspiring anecdotes, and prescriptive reminders show readers how to stop acting out their painful obsessions. Marked by compassion and keen insight, Playing It by Heart explores the author's most intense personal lessons and shows readers that, despite setbacks, recovery is a lifelong opportunity for spiritual growth.",138.0,212.0,16.51,1,9781568383385,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/5683/9781568383385.jpg,156838338X,9781568383385,en,1999-10-01,4.14,170,Playing It By Heart,335.66

Reena Tiwari emphasizes the city as a space of lived experience-an intricately layered space giving people a poetic experience, responding to their memories and desires. She also explores the conflict between two ideas: the idea of thee 'city as text' to be read and understood from a distance, and the 'city as body,' where the body, after writing the text through its performance, achieves the capacity to read and understand it. Space-Body-Ritual demonstrates that the abstract 'seeing' embedded in the 'city as a text' is underwritten by the idea of power operating at deeper levels in the city. This hidden power is the power of the user's body in space. Furthermore, Tiwari proposes that an understanding of the 'city as body' through lived experience-through rhythmanalysis, where rhythms of everyday and extra everyday practices are understood-leads to the design of an environment that is evocative and is able to generate a bodily response from the user. To understand the rhythms, it becomes essential to know the way users inhabit, understand and map or present the city spaces by their bodies.

Between Debt and the Devil challenges the belief that we need credit growth to fuel economic growth, and that rising debt is okay as long as inflation remains low. In fact, most credit is not needed for economic growth--but it drives real estate booms and busts and leads to financial crisis and depression. Turner explains why public policy needs to manage the growth and allocation of credit creation, and why debt needs to be taxed as a form of economic pollution. Banks need far more capital, real estate lending must be restricted, and we need to tackle inequality and mitigate the relentless rise of real estate prices.

Writing with verve and extraordinary range, she develops a framework for understanding contemporary issues from the debate over globalization to the intervention in Kosovo to the climate for human rights after September 11, 2001. The only comprehensive history of human rights available, this book will be essential reading for anyone concerned with humankind's quest for justice and dignity.

Some are spoken by small groups, a village or a tribe; others, much less numerous, are spoken by hundreds of millions of speakers. Certain languages, like English, French and Chinese, are highly valued, while others are largely ignored. Even if all languages are equal in the eyes of the linguist, the world's languages are in fact fundamentally unequal. All languages do not have the same value, and their inequality is at the heart of the way they are organized across the world.  In this major book Louis-Jean Calvet, one of the foremost sociolinguists working today, develops an ecological approach to language in order to analyse the changing structure of the world language system.

With incisive argumentation, he analyzes this challengingly technical world, drawing on thinkers such as J. L. Austin, Marcel Mauss, and Max Weber as theoretical guides to showcase the ways language-and particular failures in it-paved the way for ruin. Appadurai moves in four steps through his analysis. In the first, he highlights the importance of derivatives in contemporary finance, isolating them as the core technical innovation that markets have produced.

This question animated the lives and labors of the common men--and occasionally women--who made a living as alchemists in the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Holy Roman Empire. As purveyors of practical techniques, inventions, and cures, these entrepreneurs were prized by princely patrons, who relied upon alchemists to bolster their political fortunes. At the same time, satirists, artists, and other commentators used the figure of the alchemist as a symbol for Europe's social and economic ills. Drawing on criminal trial records, contracts, laboratory inventories, satires, and vernacular alchemical treatises, Alchemy and Authority in the Holy Roman Empire situates the everyday alchemists, largely invisible to modern scholars until now, at the center of the development of early modern science and commerce. Reconstructing the workaday world of entrepreneurial alchemists, Tara Nummedal shows how allegations of fraud shaped their practices and prospects. These debates not only reveal enormously diverse understandings of what the ""real"" alchemy was and who could practice it; they also connect a set of little-known practitioners to the largest questions about commerce, trust, and intellectual authority in early modern Europe.",152.0,229.0,23.0,1,9780226639727,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/2266/9780226639727.jpg,022663972X,9780226639727,en,2019-06-30,4.08,13,Alchemy and Authority in the Holy Roman Empire,412.77

In this text, Johanna Drucker shows how later art criticism has distorted our understanding of such works. She argues that Futurist, Dadaist, and Cubist artists emphasized materiality as the heart of their experimental approach to both visual and poetic forms of representation; by mid-century, however, the tenets of New Criticism and High Modernism had polarized the visual and the literary. Drucker suggests a methodology closer to the actual practices of the early avant-garde artists, based on a re-reading of their critical and theoretical writings. After reviewing theories of signification, the production of meaning, and materiality, she analyzes the work of four poets active in the typographic experimentation of the 1910s and 1920s: Ilia Zdanevich, Filippo Marinetti, Guillaume Apollinaire, and Tristan Tzara.",156.0,226.0,19.0,1,9780226165028,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/2261/9780226165028.jpg,226165027,9780226165028,en,1997-01-09,4.15,52,"The Visible Word - Experimental Typography and Modern Art, 1909-1923",472.0

Unlike Wolfram & Hart, the law firm with a similar clientele on the TV show Angel, Alanna Wolff and her partner, Jeff Byrd, have always been on the good guys' side, and their exploits are comedies. Over time, Wolff and Byrd have migrated from one comics venue to another, and now star in their own comic book, Supernatural Law, from which the stories were collected for this paperback. The stories aren't laugh-out-loud funny, but instead deal in quiet, gentle whimsy. The appealingly cartoony art maintains a light tone even in the more morbid scenes; the firm's secretary looks as if she grew up in Archie's Riverdale. Lash is overly fond of some of comics' and soap opera's kitschier clichEs. His characterizations tend to be one-dimensional; Wolff and Byrd have little personality and function as the straight men to a supporting cast of eccentrics. What's most impressive about this book are the inventive concepts. In the title story, a man with an obsessively negative attitude visually transforms into a ""photo-negative"" version of himself.

William Foote Whyte and Kathleen King Whyte describe the creation and evolution of the Mondragon cooperatives, how they have changed through decades of experience, and how they have struggled to maintain a balance between their social commitments and economic realities.

This book is a result of forty years of study, and Buber interprets the ideas and motives that underlie the great Jewish religious movement of Hasidism and its creator, Baal-Shem. Buber's interpretation of Hasidic stories and teachings influenced a new generation to turn to Hasidic teachings, and his collection Hasidism continues to affect Jewish scholarship worldwide. With his lasting work in both Hasidism and Zionism, Buber imagined a renewal in the Jewish faith, and his philosophies and idealisms enrich the pages of this book, making it a must-read for any Jewish or religious scholar. Martin Buber (1878-1965) was an Austrian-born Jewish philosopher, essayist, translator, and editor most known for his German translation of the Bible, his religious existentialism philosophy, and his role in the Zionist movement. Buber grew up in Vienna during the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which fell after World War I. He was raised by his grandparents, who introduced him to Zionism and Hasidism at a young age. Buber had a knack for language and learned more than ten different languages during his school years. After school, Buber was recruited to lecture on Jewish religious studies at universities, educational centers, and Jewish groups. In 1938, as the Nazi Party gained power, Buber left Germany and settled in Jerusalem. He continued to lecture in Jerusalem at Hebrew University. Known for politically utopist ideals including anarchism and socialism, Buber became a leader in the Zionist movement and supported a bi-national solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. In 1951 he received the Goethe award of the University of Hamburg and in 1953 the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade. In 1958, he won the Israel Prize.

Arguing instead for the pivotal role of economic and political history, Hoffman shows that if certain variables had been different, Europe would have been eclipsed, and another power could have become master of the world. Hoffman sheds light on the two millennia of economic, political, and historical changes that set European states on a distinctive path of development, military rivalry, and war. This resulted in astonishingly rapid growth in Europe's military sector, and produced an insurmountable lead in gunpowder technology. The consequences determined which states established colonial empires or ran the slave trade, and even which economies were the first to industrialize.

Dr John H Champness, Australian psychologist and educator  'Jeremy Griffith is the latest and one of the most challenging thinkers  [his book] goes against so much of the resigned don't-rock-the-boat attitude of the Western mind There are not many books offering as much. It offers so many insights into our divided selves.'  				Ronald Conway OAM, distinguished Australian psychologist 	Australian Quarterly Journal of Contemporary Analysis, Jan-Feb 2004  Why are we the way we are? Why do we do things we know we ought not to do? What do we really mean by 'original sin'? Can science explain our contradictory nature?  Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species connected humans with nature, but since then biology has been stalled, unable to address the dilemma of the human condition   our capacity for good and evil.  If the universally accepted moral ideal is to be co-operative, loving and selfless, why are we humans so competitive, aggressive and selfish?  Ignorance about ourselves, about why we behave the way we do, has been an immense affliction.  In fact, without being able to understand and to reconcile our contradictory behaviour, we have had little choice but to block out the whole depressing subject and live in a state of denial.  In A SPECIES IN DENIAL biologist Jeremy Griffith argues that only by understanding why we have become less than ideally behaved can we at last safely face the truth about our condition and learn to live in full harmony with ourselves and with others.  The 'truth sets us free', but it had to be the whole truth that explains rather than criticises us. Griffith suggests that in fact there is a biological explanation for why humans are angry, egocentric and alienated. Human 'sin' or 'upset' as he terms it, has been a necessary and unavoidable stage in our upward evolutionary development.  Life isn't driven by a competitive model of 'survival of the fittest', but rather by a drive towards greater co-operativeness and integration.  With the accumulated knowledge of science we can finally understand how, despite appearances, we have been a part of this process, and it is this liberating insight which finally brings about the maturity of the human race.  Divided into four essays A SPECIES IN DENIAL sets out Griffith's definitive treatise on the human condition:  Deciphering Plato's Cave Allegory   an explanation of how a biological understanding of the human condition can liberate humanity from its 'cave-like' state of denial.  Resignation   looks at the most important psychological event in human life.  If humans are living in a state of deep psychological denial then the question arises, are we born with this denial, and if not, when and how do we adopt it?  This essay explains how adolescents begin trying to understand the dilemma of the human condition.  However, with humanity unable   until now   to explain this deepest of issues, young people eventually learn they have no choice but to resign themselves to a life of denial.  Bringing Peace to the War between the Sexes and the Denial-Free History of the Human Race   some of the deepest wounds in human life have been caused by the lack of understanding in the relationship between men and women.  The bitterness, heartache, suffering and the damage to children has been immense.  By understanding the human condition, it is now possible to answer these questions and bring peace to the 'war' between the sexes   and give a true account of human history.   The Demystification of Religion   a powerful demonstration of how understanding the human condition and the phenomenon of resignation demystifies previously impenetrable aspects of human life, in particular, the world of religious metaphysics and dogma.    AUTHOR: JEREMY GRIFFITH, BSc, was raised on a sheep station in central New South Wales, educated at Geelong Grammar School in Victoria and later graduated in biology from Sydney University.  He spent six years in the wilds of Tasmania where he undertook the most thorough investigation ever into the plight of the Tasmanian Tiger, concluding that it was extinct.  During this time, aged 27, Jeremy shifted his exploratory focus to humanity, which has remained his life objective for the last 30 years. He started writing about the human condition in 1975, established the Foundation for Humanity's Adulthood in 1983, published his first book, Free: The End of the Human Condition in 1988 and his second book, Beyond the Human Condition in 1991.  The Foundation is a registered charity committed to promoting this new frontier of thinking.

Integrating research with clinical experience, Evan Osar identifies the psoas's role on the hip, pelvis, and low back and demonstrates how to incorporate the psoas into functional movement patterns including squatting, lunging, and bending. The Psoas Solution includes corrective and functional exercise progressions for improving and integrating the psoas into daily activities. Health and fitness professionals will find this a valuable resource full of applicable strategies and exercises to incorporate into current rehabilitation or training programs.

It has been linked to common postural and movement dysfunction including anterior pelvic tilt, hyperlordosis of the lumbar spine, and low back pain. Strategies to improve posture and reduce pain have primarily involved stretching the psoas and strengthening its antagonist, the glutes. However, recent clinical research has revealed that the psoas is much more than a simple hip flexor and plays an integral role in both posture and movement. This professional treatment manual for health care practitioners and students gives an overview of the ways that non-optimal use of the psoas can affect breathing, posture, and movement.

Offering a new approach to the study of this mass-movement known as Sabbateanism, Idel also explores the possible impact of astrology on the understanding of Sabbath as related to sorcery and thus to the concept of the encounter of witches in the late 14th and early 15th century.

Its fundamental premise is that adults learn in multiple ways, including through their consumption of fiction. As scholars have asserted for decades, people are not passive consumers of media; rather, we (re)make our own meanings as we accept, resist, and challenge cultural representations. At a time when attention often turns to new media, the contributors to this collection continue to find ""old"" forms of popular culture important and worthy of study. Television and movies--the emphases in this book--reflect aspects of consumers' lives, and can be powerful vehicles for helping adults see, experience, and inhabit the world in new and different ways. This volume moves beyond conceptually oriented scholarship, taking a decidedly research-oriented focus. It offers examples of textual and discursive analyses of television shows and films that portray varied contexts of adult learning, and suggests how participants can be brought into adult education research in this area. In so doing, it provides compelling evidence about the complexity, politics, and multidimensionality of adult teaching and learning. Using a range of television shows and movies as exemplars, chapters relate popular culture to globalization, identity, health and health care, and education.

Now, redressing the balance, there is an explosion of interest in the self-conscious emotion. Much of our psychic lives involve the negotiation of shame, asserts Michael Lewis, internationally known developmental and clinical psychologist. Shame is normal, not pathological, though opposite reactions to shame underlie many conflicts among individuals and groups, and some styles of handling shame are clearly maladaptive. Illustrating his argument with examples from everyday life, Lewis draws on his own pathbreaking studies and the theory and research of many others to construct the first comprehensive and empirically based account of emotional development focused on shame. In this paperback edition, Michael Lewis adds a compelling new chapter on stigma in which he details the process in which stigmatization produces shame.",156.0,235.0,20.0,1,9780684823119,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/6848/9780684823119.jpg,068482311X,9780684823119,en,1995-08-19,3.78,41,Shame : The Exposed Self,334.0

Some such shops are a triumph of ingenuity on a low budget, while other one-off outlets are as glamorous as their big-name counterparts. Some interiors and graphics are created by professional designers, others by the owners themselves. In fact, this trend is now so widespread that the corporate retailers who sparked the reaction in the first place are getting in on the act, commissioning one-off outlets and short-term guerrilla stores to appeal to a more savvy, funky young clientele.

LOCATING VISUAL-MATERIAL RHETORICS: THE MAP, THE MILL, AND THE GPS examines in depth, and in several contemporary settings, how visual and material discursive artifacts, when understood as rhetorical, shape our understanding of the unique cultural moments that these artifacts set out to represent. Using three cases that involve an exploration of the corporeal influence of the green spaces and commemorative sculptures at the Lowell Mills National Historical Park in Lowell, Massachusetts; the cartographic texts produced by GPS devices; and two maps involved in a federal court case about marine mammal protection, this book explores and tests the value of what Propen calls ""visual-material rhetorics,"" or a visual rhetoric more expressly attuned to studies of space, the body, and materiality. Grounding all three cases is a theoretical approach that combines Michel Foucault's theory of heterotopias with Carole Blair's theory of material rhetoric. Such an approach brings Foucault's important work on spatiality into conversation with visual-material rhetorics to show how we benefit from conceptualizing rhetorical objects as not merely textual in the traditional sense but also as both visual and material-as spatial. Together, the cases in this book demonstrate how visual-material rhetorics illuminate the contexts that shape our various lived and embodied experiences and how visual-material rhetorics function in the service of advocacy. - AMY D.

By the end of the fitting-out phase, all key stakeholders believed that the ships could never founder. The belief in Titanic's invincibility grew through the sea trials and into the maiden voyage. Everyone-from the captain and crew to the 53 millionaires on board-believed this. Why else would the wealthy and powerful have filled the hold and safes with cars and riches, and come aboard on a potentially treacherous route? Fundamentally, they believed that man had conquered nature and there was little risk.

Doctors are taught that ""miraculous"" recoveries are flukes, and as a result they don't study those cases or take them into account when treating patients. Enter Dr. Jeffrey Rediger, who has spent over 15 years studying spontaneous healing, pioneering the use of scientific tools to investigate recoveries from incurable illnesses. Dr. Rediger's research has taken him from America's top hospitals to healing centers around the world--and along the way he's uncovered insights into why some people beat the odds. In Cured, Dr. Rediger digs down to the root causes of illness, showing how to create an environment that sets the stage for healing. He reveals the patterns behind healing and lays out the physical and mental principles associated with recovery: first, we need to physically heal our diet and our immune systems. Next, we need to mentally heal our stress response and our identities. Through rigorous research, Dr. Rediger shows that much of our physical reality is created in our minds. Our perception changes our experience, even to the point of changing our physical bodies--and thus the healing of our identity may be our greatest tool to recovery.

William Cline asserts that developing countries have more at risk, such as their production capacity, than industrial countries as global warming worsens. Using general circulation models, Cline boldly examines 2071-99 to forecast the effects of global warming and its economic impact into the next decade. This detailed study outlines existing studies on climate change; Cline finds the Stern Report for the UK government's estimates most reliable; estimates projected changes in temperature, precipitation, and agricultural capacity; and concludes with policy recommendations. Cline finds that agricultural production in developing countries may fall an average of 16 percent, and if global warming progresses at its current rate, India's agricultural capacity could fall as much as 40 percent. Thus, policymakers should address this phenomenon now before the world's developing countries are adversely and irreversibly affected.",153.0,228.0,11.0,1,9780881324037,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/8813/9780881324037.jpg,881324035,9780881324037,en,2007-07-30,3.5,6,Global Warming and Agriculture - Impact Estimates by Country,302.0

The transformation from a mass-market, commodity production model to higher quality, individual producers and estates, and increasing emphasis on regional identities has been dramatic. Gilby provides detailed information on the history of wine production as well as the climate and geography that help shape the wines, and analyses the parts played by culture and politics in the development of these wine industries. For each country, Gilby supplies details on key wine styles and important grape varieties and adds a human interest angle by speaking to those involved in production and highlighting wineries to look out for. The book also features a glossary and statistical Appendices. The wines of Bulgaria, Romania and Moldova will excite wine enthusiasts keen on discovering previously untasted varieties, traditional styles and new wines.",156.0,234.0,20.0,1,9781906821876,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/9068/9781906821876.jpg,1906821879,9781906821876,en,2018-07-09,5.0,1,"The wines of Bulgaria, Romania and Moldova",500.0

On the eve of America's entry into World War II, in a tiny Alabama town, two brothers come of age in the shadow of the local chapter of the Klan, where Randall--a brilliant eighth-grader and the son of a sawmill worker--begins teaching sign language to his eighteen-year-old deaf and uneducated brother B.J. Simultaneously, in small-town Maryland, the sons of a Pullman Porter--gifted six-year-old Eliot and his artistic twelve-year-old brother Dwight--grow up navigating a world expanded both by a visit from civil and labor rights activist A. Philip Randolph and by the legacy of a lynched great-aunt. The four mature into men, directly confronting the fierce resistance to the early civil rights movement, and are all ultimately uprooted. Corthron's ear for dialogue, honed from years of theater work, brings to life all the major concerns and movements of America's past century through the organic growth of her marginalized characters, and embraces a quiet beauty in their everyday existences.

Critically engaging the positions of Marc Hauser, Daniel Dennett, Donald Davidson, John Searle, Martin Heidegger, and Hans-Georg Gadamer, among others, Steiner shows how the Western philosophical tradition has forced animals into human experiential categories in order to make sense of their cognitive abilities and moral status and how desperately we need a new approach to animal rights. Steiner rejects the traditional assumption that a lack of formal rationality confers an inferior moral status on animals vis-a-vis human beings. Instead, he offers an associationist view of animal cognition in which animals grasp and adapt to their environments without employing concepts or intentionality. Steiner challenges the standard assumption of liberal individualism according to which humans have no obligations of justice toward animals.

One of the results of this ecstasy was a prodigious output of poems about the search for the lost Divine Beloved, whom Rumi identified with Shams.

You can do this, too--I promise.""--from the introduction  Designing a room with all the vibes comes down to how you layer your décor. The more you can mix the elements of your room--your pillows, objects, patterns, and lighting--the more finished it'll feel: not too new, not too old, but just right. Known for her eclectic approach that stems from her California cool, Amber Lewis trains your eye in Made for Living,  offering friendly advice on everything from nailing that perfect shade of paint to mismatching patterns with wild abandon to choosing a stone finish for new countertops.

Parents put more time and effort into raising their children than ever before, but children's self-esteem, resilience and wellbeing don't appear to be improving. In her work as a clinical psychologist and researcher, Judith Locke, PhD sees a disturbing link between high-effort parenting and poor outcomes for children. She believes parents make their children's lives too easy by doing too much for them and giving too much to them. This type of parenting produces 'the bonsai child', an apparently perfect child raised in a protected environment and nurtured on attention to their every need. Dependent on constant care, the bonsai child can remain confined by their ideal conditions, incapable of coping in the real world. In The Bonsai Child, Judith explains why the current generation of parents and children are in this mess, why parents are encouraged to parent this way, and what often happens to their children. Most importantly, she offers practical and realistic strategies that have worked for hundreds of parents she has helped. These strategies will work for you, too. The Bonsai Child will change the way you think about parenting. This book will show you the best way to be a good parent for your child.

It was developed by the Elizabethan magician Dr. John Dee who, with the assistance of his seer, Edward Kelly, channeled an angelic language and alphabet that is remarkably effective in opening up the mind to currents of intelligence far beyond the human norm. Whether you are a beginner on your path of study or already an advanced magician, there is something for you in Enochian Initiation. Author Frater W.I.T. shares his own experiences and deeply personal visions, expanding upon and broadening the path toward understanding forged by John Dee, Aleister Crowley, and other great magicians who have come before. By bringing this practice into the modern era, Frater W.I.T. shows how human consciousness can be expanded and examined more closely than with simple meditation, psychoanalysis, or even mind-altering drugs. For those of you who might have hesitated to study Enochian magick because you do not share the same beliefs or convictions of the deeply religious Elizabethans, rest assured that it is possible to achieve the same wondrous results within a neutral spiritual context. Frater W.I.T. has developed a nonreligious spirituality in his conjurations while still using Hebrew and Enochian divine names. Through this book, you too will learn how to develop new techniques and ideas to shape your own magical style and method. An initiate of both the Masonic and Rosicrucian schools of mystery, Frater W.I.T. has spent more than twenty years studying western occult traditions.

Since the end of the Cold War, the international system has shifted from a bipolar to a unipolar structure characterized by United States dominance. This has caused EU states to cooperate in the security realm to increase their ability to project power abroad and to decrease reliance on the US. Furthermore, European leaders in the early 1990s adopted a 'binding' strategy to ensure long-term peace on the continent, suggesting that security cooperation is caused by a desire to preserve peace in Europe whilst building power abroad.",152.0,229.0,18.0,1,9780521689854,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/5216/9780521689854.jpg,521689856,9780521689854,en,2011-04-01,3.17,6,The Rise of European Security Cooperation,460.0

An important historical and spiritual journey told seamlessly."" -- The BookLife Prize 2017, Ten out of ten rating.In 1971, at age 20, Visakha had just published her first book and was beginning her ascent to fame and fortune through a career in photojournalism. She dreamed of bringing the people of the world closer by sharing their common kinship and values through her photographic essays. Then, at the invitation of her college boyfriend, who was working on his MFA thesis in India, Visakha traveled east, where she first learned about bhakti yoga - the yoga of devotion - from a simple Indian sage. The bhakti tradition seemed irrelevant to Visakha, and she rejected it. Five Years, Eleven Months and a Lifetime of Unexpected Love is Visakha's deeply personal account of the emotional upheaval caused by her doubting her own cherished convictions, by her discovery that the alarmingly unreasonable - bhakti - could gradually become alarmingly reasonable. Visakha portrays her own and others' experiences in India, Europe, and the United States as they grapple with knowledge and a culture that is at once utterly foreign yet also resonant with their hearts. And she reflects on the profound, life-altering questions that we all sometimes ask. Written by a fellow seeker who maintains a healthy dose of skepticism, this is the heartwarming, funny, colorful, bizarre, surprising, informative, and upending true story that will help questioner-skeptics see life from another perspective, one likely different from their own. In Five Years, Eleven Months, Visakha beautifully weaves together her personal losses and gains with an age-old tradition that enfolds her, creating a moving narrative for anyone who has ever asked, ""Why?""",152.0,229.0,15.0,1,9781522838449,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/5228/9781522838449.jpg,1522838449,9781522838449,en,2016-10-03,4.12,74,"Five Years, Eleven Months and a Lifetime of Unexpected Love : A Memoir",395.0

We are surrounded at all times by love and support. The aim of author Iris Belhayes, who in the year 2000 passed into the world of spirit, was and is to help readers find their way back ""home"" to the love which is there whenever we choose to experience it. In this book, Iris shared what she learned from Enid, a spirit guide who communicated with her over a period of many years. Enid's explanation of the roles of spirit guides and spirit families in our lives is one of hope, of joy and of reassurance. In this exciting view of the cosmos, all of us seek experience above all-and all experiences contribute to the world. There are no monsters, no demons, no evil creatures, except those we conceptualize and create in our own minds and imaginations. This inspirational and uplifting book can be read on two levels. One level assumes spirit guides are actual entities from the other side. The other level considers guides our own inner wisdom. Like the many-layered universe she discusses, the approach of Iris Belhayes was very rich and can be viewed from several perspectives. But all viewpoints communicated a vision that is full of hope, love and affirmation. Iris and Enid explain how each of use organizes our life according to a preset game plan that we freely choose! Our spirit guides and spirit families provide support and reassurance in helping us live out that game plan and have the many varied experiences we seek. Besides offering a sense of meaning and purpose, the author presents techniques for getting in touch with your own spirit guides. Her message is one of strength and power. She encourages readers to go beyond what they think they see and experience physically to what she calls Real Reality, which is multidimensional. She discusses some of the other levels of reality and other beings which exist, and offers instructions for how we can go beyond our ""physical universe trance states"" to even higher levels of consciousness and understanding.

Culture in Practice includes a play / review of Robert Ardrey's sociobiology, essays on ""native"" consumption patterns of food and clothes in America and the West, explorations of how two thousand years of Western cosmology have affected our understanding of others, and ethnohistorical accounts of how cultural orders of Europeans and Pacific Islanders structured the historical experiences of both. Throughout this range of scholarly inquiries and critical commentaries, Sahlins offers his own way of thinking about the anthropological project.

Robert J. Thornton explores why HIV prevalence fell during the 1990s in Uganda despite that country's having one of Africa's highest fertility rates, while, during the same period, HIV prevalence rose in South Africa, a country with Africa's lowest fertility rate. Using anthropological, epidemiological, and mathematical methods, Thornton finds that culturally and socially determined differences in the structure of sexual networks - rather than changes in individual behavior - were responsible for these radical differences in HIV prevalence. His study exposes these invisible networks, or unimagined communities, unseen both by those who participate in them and by the social sciences, and opens a new area of investigation - the sexual network as social structure.",152.0,229.0,18.0,1,9780520255531,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/5202/9780520255531.jpg,520255534,9780520255531,en,2008-10-01,3.82,11,"Unimagined Community : Sex, Networks, and AIDS in Uganda and South Africa",408.0

Among the experts' diagnoses and remedies: menstruation was an illness requiring seclusion; pregnancy, a disabling condition; and higher education, a threat to long-term health of the uterus. From clitoridectomies to tame women's behavior in the nineteenth century to the censure of a generation of mothers as castrators in the 1950s, doctors have not hesitated to intervene in women's sexual, emotional, and maternal lives. Even domesticity, the most popular prescription for a safe environment for women, spawned legions of ""scientific"" experts.  Barbara Ehrenreich and Deirdre English has never lost faith in science itself, but insist that we hold those who interpret it to higher standards.

According to the Greek creation myth, we are so much spilt milk; a splatter of the goddess Hera's breast milk became our galaxy, the Milky Way. But while mother's milk may be the essence of nourishment, it is the milk of other mammals that humans have cultivated ever since the domestication of animals more than 10,000 years ago, originally as a source of cheese, yogurt, kefir, and all manner of edible innovations that rendered lactose digestible, and then, when genetic mutation made some of us lactose-tolerant, milk itself. Before the industrial revolution, it was common for families to keep dairy cows and produce their own milk. But during the nineteenth century, mass production and urbanization made milk safety a leading issue of the day, with milk-borne illnesses a common cause of death. Pasteurization slowly became a legislative matter. And today, milk is a test case in the most pressing issues in food politics, from industrial farming and animal rights to GMOs, the locavore movement, and advocates for raw milk, who controversially reject pasteurization. Profoundly intertwined with human civilization, milk has a compelling and a surprisingly global story to tell, and historian Mark Kurlansky is the perfect person to tell it. Tracing the liquid's diverse history from antiquity to the present, he details its curious and crucial role in cultural evolution, religion, nutrition, politics, and economics.",140.0,208.0,28.0,1,9781632863836,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/mid/9781/6328/9781632863836.jpg,1632863839,9781632863836,en,2019-09-05,3.54,1018,"Milk! : A 10,000-Year Food Fracas",363.0

[23658],582228,"[3121, 3152, 3197]","The apostolic mission from Israel to """"the nations"""" forms the explicit framework for Ephesians and Colossians. Yet the concrete dynamics of this mission seldom play any significant role in modern interpretation. Scholars frequently approach these letters as if the Jew-gentile dynamics inherent in the early Christ-preaching mission are either irrelevant, or are negated by the letters themselves. This book seeks to redress this deficiency. Windsor approaches Ephesians and Colossians with an evangelical post-supersessionist perspective. By highlighting, rather than downplaying, Israel's special place in salvation history, Windsor demonstrates that Jew-gentile dynamics and missionary concerns are highly significant for understanding the overall argument of these two letters. The resulting readings offer a deeper appreciation of the biblical, Israel-centered contours in which the theological and ethical concerns of the letters are expressed. Along the way, Windsor demonstrates how certain texts in Ephesians and Colossians, which are often read as evidence of a supersessionist perspective, are capable of more fruitful and satisfactory post-supersessionist interpretations. He demonstrates that in these letters, Christ does not negate Jewish distinctiveness. Rather, Christ's mission proceeds through Israel to the nations, creating mutual blessing in the Messiah. """"What is immediately striking in Windsor's work is that we find a fresh reading of Ephesians and Colossians, one which challenges supersessionist interpretations. Still, the work doesn't have a sharp polemical edge but evidences a patient and deep reading of texts in both Ephesians and Colossians. Even those who move in different directions and dispute some of Windor's conclusions will find him to be a challenging conversation partner. Windsor's provocative and yet irenic reading of Ephesians and Colossians is an important resource for all further work in these letters."""" --Tom Schreiner, Associate Dean of Scripture and Interpretation, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary """"Fulfillment does not mean replacement without remainder. Such is Windsor's argument as he examines the need to read the Pauline epistles in the light of the dynamic of the Old Testament: the gospel concerns Israel's mission to the nations. This is a timely challenge to New Testament readers to allow Paul to speak from this perspective, and to recognize that our unity in the gospel does not mean we eliminate all distinctions, especially those between Jew and gentile."""" --Graeme Goldsworthy, Former Lecturer in Biblical Theology at Moore College, Sydney Lionel Windsor is an Anglican Minister and Lecturer in New Testament at Moore Theological College, Sydney, Australia.

God calls us to forgive those who have hurt us, but that's often easier said than done. We don't usually know how to forgive others, nor are we always sure if we have truly forgiven them. Psychologist and counselor Everett L. Worthington Jr., the leading Christian researcher on forgiveness, says that forgiving is a gift we give to others. When we offer forgiveness to others as an altruistic gift, it is more effective than when we forgive only for our own benefit in an effort to ""get over"" the hurt. True forgiveness is accomplished through a careful process of understanding both the offense and the offender and taking active steps to forgiveness. In this insightful and practical book, Worthington provides a wealth of clinically proven tools and exercises for moving toward forgiveness. Worthington's expertise comes not only from years of scientific research but also from the experience of the brutal murder of his own mother. His convictions were put to the test as he worked through his conflicting emotions and rage toward the murderer. He found that the principles of Christian forgiveness enabled him to forgive even his mother's killer. While forgiveness is something that we can do on our own, reconciliation involves another party. Worthington brings both themes together and shows how we can move beyond forgiveness and cross the bridge to reconciliation. This book, previously published as Five Steps to Forgiveness,  has been fully revised to make clear the scriptural foundations of Christian forgiveness.

It discusses the competing interpretations of the Qur'anic verses that are at the heart of Muslim controversies over polygamy, with some groups believing that Islam enshrines polygamy as a male right, others seeing it as permitted but discouraged in favour of monogamy, and other groups arguing that Islam implicitly prohibits polygamy. Based on detailed fieldwork conducted in Indonesia, it provides an empirically-based account of women's lived experiences in polygamous marriages, describing the different perceptions of the practice and strategies in dealing with it. It also considers the impact of changing public policy, in particular Indonesia's 1974 Marriage Law which restricted the practice of polygamy. It shows that, in fact, this law has not resulted in widespread adherence, and considers how public policy could be modified to increase its effectiveness in affecting behaviour in everyday life. Overall, the book argues that polygamy has been a source of injustice towards women and children, that this is against Islamic teaching, and that a just Islamic law would need to call for the abolition of polygamy.",156.0,234.0,11.68,1,9780415673877,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/4156/9780415673877.jpg,415673879,9780415673877,en,2011-04-11,4.67,3,"Women, Islam and Everyday Life : Renegotiating Polygamy in Indonesia",318.0

There is growing concern that we are becoming a liberal nation-state with an increasingly anti-liberal population and an electorate that is disinterested in politics. In this globalized world, the power of capital is so great that opposition to it is often discouraged and disheartened, leaving many citizens few political precepts by which to consider their institutions. This contemporary failure of vision has opened the way for the unimpeded return of the philosophy of the free market. As a result, social and educational policies are debated almost solely in terms of how they fit with the needs of the market. Social and ethical understandings are replaced by a failed economic theory that requires a radical constraint of our political and economic choices. Compassion for the poor, the market lets us know, is wrong-headed because any interference with the labor market will always result in unfortunate economic and social consequences. Moral issues are eclipsed by market needs.

Today we pay with zeroes and ones -digital entries on credit and debit cards, or electronic messages sent over the Internet. In Moving Money , distinguished analysts explore this trend, its development and likely future, and the ramifications of this transformation. This is a book about money as a medium of exchange -in the past, in the present, but particularly in the future. What forms has money taken over the years? Moreover, how have those means of payment changed in recent years, and how will they develop in the future? And what (if anything) should policymakers do to facilitate those changes, or at least allow them to develop and mature? Brookings economists Robert E. Litan and Martin Neil Baily and a distinguished group of experts dissect these issues and peer into the future of consumer payments. The landscape of the consumer payments industry will be shaped at least in part by public policies. Historically, governments have had monopolies on the manufacture of money. Any form of payment clearly requires trust on the part of both the seller and the buyer, and the government must establish and enforce laws to secure this relationship. More controversial is the issue of whether, and to what extent, government is also needed to protect the market in private sector payments systems. Why do these issues matter? The payments industry is a large and important sector of developed economies. In the United States, private-sector payments providers generate approximately $280 billion a year in revenue, while the government invests substantial resources into making money (minting coins and printing bills) or moving it (via checks and various electronic transfers). And the way we pay for things influences our purchases -what we spend money on, how much we spend, and where we spend it. Thus the future of consumer payments is intertwined with the health of national economies. Contributors: Martin Neil Baily (Brookings), Thomas P.

The text, richly illustrated, consists at the start of carefully graded adaptations from original Classical Latin texts. The adaptations are gradually phased out until unadultered prose and verse can be read. The Grammar, Vocabulary and Exercises volume supplies all the help needed to do this, together with a range of reinforcing exercises for each section, including English into Latin for those who want it. At the end of each section, a selection of Latin epigrams, mottoes, quotations, everyday Latin, word-derivations, examples of mediaeval Latin and discussions of the influence of Latin upon English illustrate the language's impact on Western culture. Reading Latin is principally designed for university and adult beginners, and also for sixth-formers (eleventh and twelth graders in the USA).

But how does HBS formally and informally ensure faculty and students embrace proper business standards? Relying on his first-hand experience as a Harvard Business School faculty member, Michel Anteby takes readers inside HBS in order to draw vivid parallels between the socialization of faculty and of students. In an era when many organizations are focused on principles of responsibility, Harvard Business School has long tried to promote better business standards. Anteby's rich account reveals the surprising role of silence and ambiguity in HBS's process of codifying morals and business values.

Troubled restaurant inspector Danny Skinner is on a quest to find the mysterious father his mother will not identify. Unraveling this hidden information is the key to understanding the crippling compulsions that threaten to wreck his young life. His ensuing journey takes him from the festival city of Edinburgh to the foodie city of San Francisco. But the hard-drinking, womanizing Skinner has a strange nemesis in the form of mild-mannered fellow inspector Brian Kibby. It is Skinner's unfathomable, obsessive hatred of Kibby that takes over everything, threatening to destroy not only Skinner and his mission but also those he loves most dearly. When Kibby contracts a horrific, undiagnosable illness, Skinner understands that his destiny is inextricably bound to that of his hated rival, and he is faced with a terrible dilemma.

It begins by recognising that the most fundamental scientific 'fact' is not the existence of an objective physical universe, but our subjective experience of it. However, even the most advanced 'quantum' science cannot explain even elementary qualities of our sensory experiencing - the experience of 'redness' for example. Qualia are usually defined as experiences of sensory qualities. But what if awareness is not a blank receptacle for sensory experiences but has its own innately sensual or soul qualities, qualities such as the inwardly sensed colour, tone and texture of our moods - or the sensed inner 'warmth' or 'coolness' of another human being.

One of his lifelong ambitions  was to write a book to counter the ""errors of the infidels"", to  which end he studied Arabic and immersed himself in whatever  arabic texts he could obtain. The Book of the Lover is one of the  most celebrated works of medieval mystical literature offering a  uniquely expressed and moving testimony to the soul's quest for  union with God.

Yet Jewish women have always prayed and, before prayer became standardized into a formal liturgy, Israelite women offered up spontaneous petitions and hymns to God as freely as did men. While they may not have been able to help constitute a minyan, and while many did not know Hebrew or Aramaic, women produced and used material for prayer at home.  The Yiddish tkhines had its origin in a form of supplicatory prayer in the Talmud, whose original intent was to allow for individual private devotion during the standard prayer service. The private Yiddish prayers and devotions for Jewish women continued to use this term. They emerged in the world of premodern Ashkenazic Jewry and represent one of the richest and least-known forms of Jewish religious literature. Because modern sensibility seemed to reject them, and because Yiddish was quickly forgotten by second and third generation Jews in the West, they have been sadly neglected. Although a few have been individually translated into English, this is the first bilingual anthology ever to appear.  The prayers in this volume are characterized by a highly personal and intimate style and mark occasions in the religious calendar, such as the Tkhine for the Blessing of the New Moon, as well as occasions in the life of a woman, such as the Tkhine for a Mother who Leads Her Child to Kheyder for the First Time.

Here we meet Shalev's amazing Grandma Tonia, who arrived in Palestine by boat from Russia in 1923 and lived in a constant state of battle with what she viewed as the family's biggest enemy in their new land: dirt. Grandma Tonia was never seen without a cleaning rag over her shoulder. She received visitors outdoors. She allowed only the most privileged guests to enter her spotless house. Hilarious and touching, Grandma Tonia and her regulations come richly to life in a narrative that circles around the arrival into the family's dusty agricultural midst of the big, shiny American sweeper sent as a gift by Great-uncle Yeshayahu (he who had shockingly emigrated to the sinful capitalist heaven of Los Angeles!). America, to little Meir and to his forebears, was a land of hedonism and enchanting progress; of tempting luxuries, dangerous music, and degenerate gum-chewing; and of women with painted fingernails. The sweeper, a stealth weapon from Grandpa Aharon's American brother meant to beguile the hardworking socialist household with a bit of American ease, was symbolic of the conflicts and visions of the family in every respect. The fate of Tonia's ""svieeperrr""--hidden away for decades in a spotless closed-off bathroom after its initial use--is a family mystery that Shalev determines to solve. The result, in this cheerful translation by Evan Fallenberg, is pure delight, as Shalev brings to life the obsessive but loving Tonia, the pioneers who gave his childhood its spirit of wonder, and the grit and humor of people building ever-new lives.",129.54,200.66,17.78,1,9780805212402,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/8052/9780805212402.jpg,080521240X,9780805212402,en,2018-03-01,3.79,1540,My Russian Grandmother and her American Vacuum Cleaner: A Family Memoir,226.8

The Nine Bodies teachings map out a journey that starts with consciousness that arises in the physical body and is directly observable, and then travels through ever more subtle levels of consciousness to that which is not manifest and is only potential, and therefore has to be inferred. The book includes a series of mysterious illustrations that Balyogi created during his time of intense Samadhi explorations. Each illustration is a rich composition of symbols that express aspects of inner experiences that are almost impossible to express with language. Moffitt makes these teachings available for meditation students from all spiritual traditions to use as gateways for exploring the nature of mind and as additional means for tracking and classifying meditative experiences.

Until recently bucchero has been little studied, and the aim of this book is to present a sequence of pottery from archaeological contexts, so that the development of the ware can be seen as a whole within a chronological framework. Many of the tomb-groups catalogued are published here for the first time. In studying the shapes careful consideration is given to the affinities with Greek and with other Etruscan wares. A full survey of the decorative techniques is included, and the pattern of distribution both within Etruria and further afield is discussed. An important feature of the book is a series of sixty pages of drawings of the profiles of every shape of bucchero pot studied.

In the operating room, surgeons and their teams communicate in a very precise language; airplane pilots follow a strict protocol to take off and land safely every time; and, when launching a new product, companies lay out a plan that all employees follow. But when it comes to building a strong service culture, the path to success is usually much less clear. We relegate service to a single department guided by anecdotal wisdom and less-than-helpful cliches like the customer is always right.With global economies transforming at record speed, we are largely unprepared for the service demands we face day and night from around the world. We promise our customers satisfaction and then allow internal politics and inefficient methods to frustrate our ability to deliver. With service so much a part of our daily lives, both in and outside the workplace, why aren't we doing it better? New York Times bestselling author Ron Kaufman knows the answer to this question, and not only believes we can do it better, but shows us how. In Uplifting Service he takes you on a journey into a new world of service that is guided by fundamental principles and actionable models. After more than two decades helping leaders transform their service cultures, Kaufman has discovered that while each successful team is different, the architecture they apply to build an uplifting service culture is the same.In this New York Times, USA Today, and Amazon.com bestselling book, Kaufman lays out the steps you can take to build a sustainable culture that delivers outstanding service every day. He offers the tools and practices that have been proven effective in businesses, governments, communities, and homes; on every continent; and in many languages. Through perspective-changing insights and case studies, you will learn how the world's best performing companies have changed the game through service and how you too can follow this proven path to an uplifting transformation.""",160.02,228.6,38.1,2,9780984762507,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/9847/9780984762507.jpg,984762507,9780984762507,en,2012-12-13,3.89,262,Uplifting Service,657.71

The Council's authority depends on its legitimacy, and therefore its legitimation and delegitimation are of the highest importance to states. Through an examination of the politics of the Security Council, including the Iraq invasion and the negotiating history of the United Nations Charter, Hurd shows that when states use the Council's legitimacy for their own purposes, they reaffirm its stature and find themselves contributing to its authority. Case studies of the Libyan sanctions, peacekeeping efforts, and the symbolic politics of the Council demonstrate how the legitimacy of the Council shapes world politics and how legitimated authority can be transferred from states to international organizations.

Though largely ignored by orthodox historians, the Freemasons, Knights Templar, and Rosicrucians affected the course of the French and American Revolutions as well as the overthrow of the medieval feudal order. Inevitably, the true ideals and esoteric practices of these societies have, at times, been perverted by self-serving individuals. The Nazis and the Bolsheviks, British security forces, the founding fathers of America, and the Vatican have all justified their actions--for good or for ill--by claiming the mystic ideals of secret societies. Michael Howard explores these connections, tracing their effects in politics and statecraft from the time of ancient Egypt up to the present. He sheds light on the influence of secret societies on governments and in the lives of many well-known figures, including Frederick the Great, John Dee, Francis Bacon, Benjamin Franklin, Comte de Cagliostro, Helena Blavatsky, Rasputin, and Woodrow Wilson.

His new in-depth (100+ page) article, Option Income Strategy Trade Filters, represents the culmination of years of research into developing a systematic framework for optimizing the timing of Option Income Strategy (OIS) trades. His research was based on the analysis of 15,434 OIS trades, each with a comprehensive set of objective, tradable entry and exit rules. The results for each of the 15,000 plus trades were scaled to a constant dollar amount at risk, to ensure all trades were equally-weighted when calculating the performance metrics. The back-test results were all based on actual option prices and are summarized in this article for a selection of back-testing filters, making this one of the most comprehensive studies of option income strategy results ever published. The results of over 100 different back-tests are provided. The OIS strategy back-test results for ten different types of filters are evaluated in this article, including unique filter combinations that delivered exceptional results. A custom market-edge hypothesis was created in advance for each filter type, which was then used to evaluate the filter-specific results. This critical step helped identify robust, exploitable relationships, rather than spurious correlations. Several of the resulting filters generated over 95% winning trades, with average returns of over six percent per trade (including losing trades). The ratios of cumulative gains to cumulative losses were over 20 to 1 for a few of the best performing filters. Option Income Strategy Trade Filters is written in a clear, understandable fashion and provides detailed examples of how to create and test market-edge hypotheses using the recent advances in back-testing software. Very few formulas were included. As a result, the material in the article should be accessible to all option traders. Useful for traders with a wide range of option trading experience, this practical guide begins with a detailed review of option income strategies, including basic examples that provide the requisite foundation for subsequent chapters. Portions of this crucial background material also appeared in Brian Johnson's first book: Option Strategy Risk / Return Ratios. Chapter 2 includes a comprehensive description of the option income strategy, position model, and trade plan used to generate the back-test data. Every entry and exit rule is explained in detail, including actual graphical examples. The performance metrics for the 15,434 unfiltered OIS trades are summarized at the end of this chapter, which provide a performance benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of the trade filters introduced in the next three chapters. The trade filters are grouped by classification, with a chapter devoted to each class or type. The market-edge hypotheses and corresponding results for trend filters are analyzed in Chapter 3. Unlike trend filters, discriminating filters exclude an increasing percentage of trades as the filter condition or threshold becomes more extreme or restrictive. The discriminating filter market-edge hypotheses and results are analyzed in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 is devoted entirely to a very unique and powerful example of a discriminating filter: the OIS Universal Filter (OISUF). The final chapter examines practical considerations and prospective applications of trade filters and other resources in managing option income strategies in actual market conditions.",152.0,229.0,6.0,1,9780996182317,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/9961/9780996182317.jpg,996182314,9780996182317,en,2016-11-05,4.0,1,Option Income Strategy Trade Filters : An In-Depth Article Demonstrating the Use of Trade Filters to Enhance Returns and Reduce Risk,159.0

Homer's story is thrilling, and his Greek is perhaps the most beautiful poetry ever sung or written. But until now, even the best English translations haven't been able to re-create the energy and simplicity, the speed, grace, and pulsing rhythm of the original. Now, thanks to the power of Stephen Mitchell's language, the Iliad's ancient story comes to moving, vivid new life, and we are carried along by a poetry that lifts even the most devastating human events into the realm of the beautiful. Mitchell's Iliad is also the first translation based on the work of the preeminent Homeric scholar Martin L. West, whose edition of the original Greek identifies many passages that were added after the Iliad was first written down, to the detriment of the music and the story.

In a similar way, the postmodern philosopher of history suggests that history is literature, or that if we read certain historical details differently we would get a distinctly different interpretation of past events. While the science fiction alternate history means to illuminate the past, to increase our understanding of past events, however, the postmodern approach to history typically suggests that such understanding is impossible. To the postmodern philosopher, history is like literature in that it does not offer the reader access to the past, but only an interesting story. Building on criticism that suggests personal psychological reasons for this obscuring the past, and using a literary theory of readership, this book challenges the postmodern approach to history. It channels the speculative power of science fiction to read the works of postmodern philosophy of history as alternate histories themselves, and to map the limits and pathology of their forgetful reading of the past.",169.0,247.0,19.0,2,9780739196175,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/7391/9780739196175.jpg,739196170,9780739196175,en,2014-11-25,3.5,2,"Relativism, Alternate History, and the Forgetful Reader : Reading Science Fiction and Historiography",431.0

Ortega was the man of the people, intent on forming a socialist government of equality in the Central American country. Today Ortega crushes dissent from the people he ""liberated,"" joining Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela as just another ""elected"" dictator who has destroyed his country through the implementation of socialism.

Although little is known about Patanjali (most scholars estimate that he lived in India circa 200-300 B.C.), his writings have long been recognized as a vital contribution to the philosophy and practice of yoga. This new, expert translation of the original Sanskrit text of Patanjali's best-known work presents his seminal ideas and methods in accessible, plain-language English. Patanjali organized the sutra into four parts: Samadhi (absorption), Sadhana (practice), Vibhuti (supernatural powers), and Kaivalya (liberation). Each represents a step in breaking free of our limited definition of consciousness and training the mind to achieve oneness with the universe. Geshe Michael Roach, one of the most respected teachers of Tibetan Buddhism in America and a renowned scholar of Sanskrit, provides authoritative commentary on each of the sutras. His notes and clarification are straightforward and highly readable, untainted by obscure, academic terminology or New Age jargon.

Professor Jenson sees the heart of the gospel as the unconditional promise of the ultimate triumph of the love of Jesus of Nazareth. This gospel is based on the story of Jesus and is worked out in the lives of men and of nations as the promise it brings moves towards fulfillment. Story and Promise--we dare to call it a """"one-volume dogmatics""""--leaves no element of the Christian faith untouched: the classical doctrines concerning God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, man, the church; the clearly radical implications of these doctrines for personal and social transformation; the focus of Christian vision on the future as the time when God comes and man becomes what God intends. This book clarifies the traditional problems of faith, and also raises the revolutionary issues marking the end of this century. It is a thoughtful and satisfying piece of systematic theology in a time of shattered understandings of the faith. Robert W. Jenson has been a student of Barthian theology for many years, and his doctoral dissertation at the University of Heidelberg earned Barth's approval as an interpretation of his writings. Dr. Jenson attended Luther College in Iowa and the Lutheran Theological Seminary in St. Paul, MN, before studying at Heidelberg, where he was awarded his Doctorate of Theology, summa cum laude. After completing graduate work at the University of Basel, he taught theology for many years at St. Olaf College in Northfield, MN, the Lutheran Theological Seminary in Gettysburg, PA, and Oxford University.

The Inner Chapters are the only sustained section of this text widely believed to be the work of Chuang Tzu himself, dating to the fourth century B.C.E. Witty and engaging, spiced with the lyricism of poetry, Chuang Tzu's Taoist insights are timely and eternal, profoundly concerned with spiritual ecology. Indeed, the Tao of Chuang Tzu was a wholesale rejection of a human-centered approach. Zen traces its sources back to these Taoist roots -- roots at least as deep as those provided by Buddhism. But this is an ancient text that yields a surprisingly modern effect. In bold and startling prose, David Hinton's translation captures the ""zany texture and philosophical abandon"" of the original. The Inner Chapters' fantastical passages -- in which even birds and trees teach us what they know -- offer up a wild menagerie of characters, freewheeling play with language, and surreal humor. And interwoven with Chuang Tzu's sharp instruction on the Tao are short-short stories that are often rough and ribald, rich with satire and paradox. On their deepest level, the Inner Chapters are a meditation on the mysteries of knowledge itself. ""Chuang Tzu's propositions,"" the translator's introduction reminds us, ""seem to be in constant transformation, for he deploys words and concepts only to free us of words and concepts.""

Guggenheim, asking the architect to design a new building to house Guggenheim's four-year-old Museum of Non-Objective Painting. The project evolved into a complex struggle pitting the architect against his clients, city officials, the art world and public opinion, but the resultant achievement testifies to both Wright's architectural genius and the adventurous spirit of its founders. The Guggenheim Museum is an embodiment of Wright's attempts to render the inherent plasticity of organic forms in architecture. His inverted ziggurat dispensed with the conventional approach to museum design, which led visitors through a series of interconnected rooms and forced them to retrace their steps when exiting. Instead, Wright whisked people to the top of the building via elevator, and led them downward at a leisurely pace on the gentle slope of a continuous ramp. The galleries were divided like the segments of an orange, into self-contained yet interdependent sections. The open rotunda afforded viewers the unique possibility of seeing several bays of work on different levels simultaneously. The spiral design recalled a nautilus shell, with continuous spaces flowing freely one into another. Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: An Architectural Appreciation celebrates Wright's crowning achievement with reflections by prominent architects, historians and critics.

How might anxiety be a matter of an interrupted horizontal line, or grief a figure of blazing light?Offering a bold corrective to the emphasis on embodiment and experience in recent affect theory, Eugenie Brinkema develops a novel mode of criticism that locates the forms of particular affects within the specific details of cinematic and textual construction. Through close readings of works by Roland Barthes, Hollis Frampton, Sigmund Freud, Peter Greenaway, Michael Haneke, Alfred Hitchcock, Soren Kierkegaard, and David Lynch, Brinkema shows that deep attention to form, structure, and aesthetics enables a fundamental rethinking of the study of sensation. In the process, she delves into concepts as diverse as putrescence in French gastronomy, the role of the tear in philosophies of emotion, Nietzschean joy as a wild aesthetic of repetition, and the psychoanalytic theory of embarrassment.

The term allows those who brandish it in the name of Islam to 'freeze' the latter, making reform difficult. Whereas Christianity and Judaism have been rejuvenated over the centuries by external criticism, Islam has been shielded from critical examination and has remained impervious to change. This tendency is exacerbated by the hypocrisy of those Western defenders of Islam who, in the name of the principles of the Enlightenment, seek to muzzle its critics while at the same time demanding the right to chastise and criticize other religions. These developments, argues Bruckner, are counter-productive for Western democracies as they struggle with the twin challenges of immigration and terrorism. The return of religion in those democracies must not be equated with the defence of fanaticism, and the right to religious freedom must go hand in hand with freedom of expression, an openness to criticism, and a rejection of all forms of extremism.",141.0,222.0,21.0,2,9781509530649,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/5095/9781509530649.jpg,1509530649,9781509530649,en,2018-11-13,3.53,15,An Imaginary Racism : Islamophobia and Guilt,388.0

The new Electo-U-boats were the first submarines to operate primarily submerged, as opposed to spending large periods of time on the surface. Hitler s new designs utilized huge number of batteries to improve the time they could spend underwater, as much as several days, and only needed to surface to periscope depth for recharging via a snorkel.

The First Presidency rebuked him, his fellow apostles wanted him disciplined, and grassroots Mormons called for his removal from the Quorum of the Twelve.

And regardless of category, it all boils down to one simple question : What is, and is NOT, Feng Shui? Indeed, the answer to this question is the key that will subsequently unravel and in fact, debunk, many a myth and misconception shrouding this metaphysical science today. With this in mind, Joey returns with More Stories & Lessons on Feng Shui!   In this book, Joey shares with readers the many essential tips on Feng Shui that anyone and everyone will find useful and practical to apply.  He starts by demystifying the many misunderstandings and myths surrounding Classical Feng Shui, before moving on to share his viewpoint on topics as diverse as the role -or lack thereof- of symbols and numbers in Feng Shui, to addressing more profound matters such as Yang and Yin House Feng Shui.   More Stories & Lessons on Feng Shui ends with the author narrating his experience while taking his students to Walk the Mountains of China, in honing the latter's Feng Shui skills.   In diversifying the topics in this sequel to cater to the avid Chinese Metaphysics enthusiast's thirst of knowledge, Joey also touches on other Chinese Metaphysical subjects such as BaZi (destiny analysis), Mian Xiang (Face Reading) and Yi Jing (The Science of Probability). All in all, More Stories & Lessons on Feng Shui is a delightful compilation of Joey's articles, featured in national and international magazines and newspapers that have been purposely refined, edited and expanded upon to make for a light-hearted, interesting yet educational read.

Today there are more snow machines than dogs in her native Nunavik, a region that is part of the homeland of the Inuit in Canada. In Inuktitut, the language of Inuit, the elders say that the weather is Uggianaqtuq-behaving in strange and unexpected ways.

The Right to Be Cold is at once the intimate coming-of-age story of a remarkable woman, a deeply informed look at the life and culture of an Indigenous community reeling from a colonial history and now threatened by climate change, and a stirring account of an activist's powerful efforts to safeguard Inuit culture, the Arctic, and the planet.",133.0,216.0,30.48,1,9781517904975,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/mid/9781/5179/9781517904975.jpg,1517904978,9781517904975,en,2018-05-01,3.52,1035,The Right to Be Cold : One Woman's Fight to Protect the Arctic and Save the Planet from Climate Change,430.91

So pervasive are the devices of racecraft in American history, economic doctrine, politics, and everyday thinking that the presence of racecraft itself goes unnoticed.

And yet these two communities have found their destinies intertwined in the conquest of new markets, as Suzanne Mustacich shows in this provocative account of how China is reshaping the French wine business and how Bordeaux is making its mark on China. Thirsty Dragon lays bare the untold story of how an influx of Chinese money rescued France's most venerable wine region from economic collapse, and how the result was a series of misunderstandings and crises that threatened the delicate infrastructure of Bordeaux's insular wine trade. The Bordelais and the Chinese do business according to different and often incompatible sets of rules, and Mustacich uncovers the competing agendas and little-known actors who are transforming the economics and culture of Bordeaux, even as its wines are finding new markets-and ever higher prices-in Shanghai, Beijing, and Hong Kong, with Hong Kong and London traders playing a pivotal role.",162.0,244.0,32.0,2,9781627790871,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/6277/9781627790871.jpg,162779087X,9781627790871,en,2016-01-12,3.71,55,Thirsty Dragon : China's Lust for Bordeaux and the Threat to the World's Best Wines,544.31

Named One of America's hottest little retailers by Fortune magazine, Mary Carol Garrity's mini empire of three decor stores are a Midwest regional phenomenon and have become landmarks in the decorating world. In Nell Hill's Rooms We Love, we will see Mary Carol apply her Nell Hill's principles of design to new challenges. Even though design styles and trends have changed significantly since Nell Hill's Style at Home, Mary Carol's first book ten years ago, the rules that guide her approach to decorating have not. In this book, we will rediscover those principles at work in four very different houses, in addition to her own home. In the book, we will visit rooms inspired by the needs of each homeowner and will see how they transformed their rooms using Mary Carol's inspiration and tricks of the trade. We will observe: - A century-old English Tudor in a city neighborhood, reinvented for empty nesters - A suburban tear-down that was rebuilt for a growing family - A home in the country, newly built but with an old soul - A sweeping country manor with one-of-a kind rooms While traveling through these homes, Mary Carol will construct the process and provide readers with the blueprint she uses for discovering personal styles. We hope you will be inspired by these rooms and will come away with creative energy to make your rooms beautiful, functional, colorful, and comfortable.

In this new book, Mary Carol deconstructs the process that helps her work with the myriad of decorating challenges from her customers. It is a big order to think about redoing a room in a house, committing to a paint color or wallpaper, dozens of yards of fabric, new upholstery, area rugs that you will be living with for a while, and the investment of dollars and time spent on the makeover. Mary Carol demystifies the process by showing us through rooms she loves and calling out details that go into making the room successful. Mary Carol defines success in decorating by working with customers to identify their own personal style. While the stores of Nell Hill's are packed full of great room settings, tableaus, and both big and little surprises, Mary Carol believes that people have a personal style that is uniquely their own. Her goal is to help you discover your own style by offering some guiding principles for your decisions. Mary Carol's Guiding Principles - Mary Carol believes that your style comes from mixing old with new, showcasing your keepsake treasures as well as your newly discovered surprises. - And she believes in comfort--providing spaces where you can sit down with a book and get cozy or where your guests will find a special amenity waiting just for them. - Mary Carol believes that a beautiful room always offers an unexpected delight. - She encourages you to bring the outdoors inside, using garden structures year-round in seasonal decorating.",187.0,260.0,20.32,2,9781449421649,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/4494/9781449421649.jpg,1449421644,9781449421649,en,2013-11-01,3.33,43,Nell Hill's Rooms We Love,698.53

Return to the Hundred Acre Wood in A.A. Milne's second collection of Pooh stories, The House at Pooh Corner. Here you will rediscover all the characters you met in Winnie-the-Pooh Christopher Robin, Eeyore, Owl, Piglet, Kanga, tiny Roo, and, of course, Pooh himself. Joining them is the thoroughly bouncy and lovable Tigger, who leads the rest into unforgettable adventures. Since 1926, Winnie-the-Pooh and his friends have endured as the unforgettable creations of A.A. Milne, who wrote these stories for his son, Christopher Robin, and Ernest H. Shepard, who lovingly gave Pooh and his companions shape. These characters and their stories are timeless treasures of childhood that continue to speak to all of us with the kind of freshness and heart that distinguishes true storytelling. The adventures of Christopher Robin, Winnie-the-Pooh, and all their friends in the storied Forest around Pooh Corner.

He discusses the ways in which the divine thought, and the human thinking that sought faithfully to interpret it, actually came to expression and treats what he calls the grammar of the divine self-expression in order to help us see the theological structure that it implies. Then he shows how this implicit system is expressed in the rules for the life of the people that God has chosen as his own.

For example, if a card falls out of the deck while you are shuffling them you should never put that card back in the deck. The card fell out for a reason.

This means that they are the best to find excessive symptoms, which are symptoms that express pain, inflammations and degeneration. This book teaches to find deficient symptoms, and in this aspect veterinarians are not necessarily the best diagnostics. They may be so, but then they have to educate themselves in a way described in this book. In my opinion, detecting deficient symptoms, lay-people may as good as the veterinarian. This book can be used by the veterinarian as a reference on Complementary Veterinary Medicine, and give useful information on how to treat sick animals; it is not intended for use as a ""Cookbook"" on how to treat animals. Both veterinarians and not-veterinarians must understand this; otherwise they may use it (possibly in vain) only to find a recipe to heal, for example, chronic mastitis in their favourite cow, or lameness in their horse or dog. If they do so, they will miss the whole purpose of the book, which is to give readers basic information on Holistic Veterinary Medicine, based on the detection of deficient processes. The book aims to introduce readers to the concepts of Fundamental Processes from which many holistic therapies have developed, how these methods function and how they can be put to practical use to treat sick animals. In order to be able to cope with the huge and expanding market of healers, quacks, methods and aids offered today, it is very important to be able to think in a holistic way. Only by going deeply into the principles of holistic thinking can we give our animals the best treatment and be able to recognise the many charlatans in the area for what they are. Only when one has studied and grasped the basic thinking processes of holistic medicine can one use its schemata, recipes or cookbook prescriptions with good conscience. Therefore a list of therapeutic suggestions is included after the chapters on acupuncture (AP) and homeopathy. Every method in this book is discussed in three different ways: first the -Theoretical thought processes, then the -Practical thought processes and finally -Therapeutic suggestions, i.e. recipes and schemata and other necessary details. For those especially interested, I have included -Philosophical and theoretical approaches in several places. These are printed in italics and marked with an old Celtic sign at the beginning and end.

War is rarely a predictable enterprise-it is a mess of luck, chance, and incalculable variables. Today's sure winner can easily become tomorrow's doomed loser.

In Chicago, a woman learns that an elite team of ex-army investigators is being hunted down one by one.... And on the streets of Portland, Jack Reacher--soldier, cop, hero--is pulled out of his wandering life by a code that few other people could understand. From the first shocking scenes in Lee Child's explosive new novel, Jack Reacher is plunged like a knife into the heart of a conspiracy that is killing old friends...and is on its way to something even worse.  A decade postmilitary, Reacher has an ATM card and the clothes on his back--no phone, no ties, and no address. But now a woman from his old unit has done the impossible. From Chicago, Frances Neagley finds Reacher, using a signal only the eight members of their elite team of army investigators would know. She tells him a terrifying story--about the brutal death of a man they both served with. Soon Reacher is reuniting with the survivors of his old team, scrambling to raise the living, bury the dead, and connect the dots in a mystery that is growing darker by the day. The deeper they dig, the more they don' t know: about two other comrades who have suddenly gone missing--and a trail that leads into the neon of Vegas and the darkness of international terrorism.  For now, Reacher can only react. To every sound. Every suspicion. Every scent and every moment. Then Reacher will trust the people he once trusted with his life--and take this thing all the way to the end.

The sensitivity of climate to changes in atmospheric CO2 was first estimated about one century ago, and the rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration was discovered half a century ago.

And why do a small number of other states succeed in such control? What effect do failing laws and social policies have on the state itself? In answering these questions, Joel Migdal takes a new look at the role of the state in the third world. Strong Societies and Weak States offers a fresh approach to the study of state-society relations and to the possibilities for economic and political reforms in the third world. In Asia, Africa, and Latin America, state institutions have established a permanent presence among the populations of even the most remote villages. A close look at the performance of these agencies, however, reveals that often they operate on principles radically different from those conceived by their founders and creators in the capital city. Migdal proposes an answer to this paradox: a model of state-society relations that highlights the state's struggle with other social organizations and a theory that explains the differing abilities of states to predominate in those struggles.",152.0,235.0,19.56,1,9780691010731,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/6910/9780691010731.jpg,691010730,9780691010731,en,1988-11-21,3.91,93,Strong Societies and Weak States : State-Society Relations and State Capabilities in the Third World,425.0

The prologue offers a novel reading of the idea of 'the people of God, ' placing the people firmly 'in the world.' In this spirit, the book brings argument to bear on a broad range of contemporary moral, social, and political controversies, many of them turning on puzzles about identity. The scope extends from Judaism, Zionism, and anti-Semitism to the language of race, the status of animals, and the rights of the child. Drawing on his training as an academic philosopher, his Jewish education, and his personal experience, author Brian Klug confronts uncomfortable questions with rigor, candor, and humor. And while the chapters are not a series of steps in an overall argument, collectively they develop the title theme: the inner connection between being Jewish and doing justice. Topical and controversial, the issues discussed include: whether anti-Zionism is a form of anti-Semitism * Herzl's Jewish opponents in the East End * if anti-Semitism and anti-Americanism are inextricably entangled * what draws America to Israel and what ties Israel to Auschwitz * how the climate of debate about Israel among Jews can be improved * Israel's 'right to exist' * the 'race question' on the UK census form * Arthur Balfour's take on 'the Jewish race' * ethnicity in America * Black-Jewish relations in Chicago * popular attitudes in Britain towards the 'ritual' slaughter of animals * the treatment of animals in the abattoir and laboratory",155.0,234.0,33.0,1,9780853039938,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/8530/9780853039938.jpg,853039933,9780853039938,en,2012-02-29,2.0,1,Being Jewish and Doing Justice : Bringing Argument to Life,703.0

By their territorial scale, number of participating troops, length and casualties, the military operations in the area of the Rzhev - Viaz'ma salient are not only comparable to the Stalingrad battle, but to a great extent surpass it.

Why were the forces of the German Army Group Center in the Rzhev - Viaz'ma salient not encircled and destroyed?

He died in Down, around 460. 'The Confession of St Patrick' and 'Letter to the Soldiers of Coroticus' are both written by the Saint himself. The 'Confession' was penned as a response to (unfounded) attacks on Patrick's integrity, while the 'Letter' derives from a slave-collecting attack undertaken by soldiers of the Scottish Christian King Coroticus, and reveals Patrick's incandescent rhetorical style. Both these unique documents open a window to the voice of the Saint, speaking more than 1500 years before our own time.

There is the ""good breast"" of reverence and life, the breast that nourishes infants and entire communities, as depicted in ancient idols, fifteenth-century Italian Madonnas, and representations of equality in the French Revolution. Then there is the ""bad breast"" of Ezekiel's wanton harlots, Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth, and the torpedo-breasted dominatrix, symbolizing enticement and aggression. Yalom examines these contradictions--and illuminates the implications behind them. A fascinating, astute, and richly allusive journey from Paleolithic goddesses to modern day feminists, A History of the Breast is full of insight and surprises.

In this book, an attempt is made to fill this gap by focusing on issues of concept-formation in legal science in general with a view to their application to the specific concerns of international law. In responding to these issues, the author argues that public international law seeks to establish and institutionalise a system of authoritative judgment whereby the conditions by which a community of states can co-exist and co-operate are ensured. A state, in turn, must be understood as ultimately deriving legitimacy from the pursuit of the human dignity of the community it governs, as well as the dignity of those human beings and states affected by its actions in international relations. This argument is in line with a long and now resurgent Kantian tradition in legal and political philosophy. The book shows how this approach is reflected in accepted paradigm cases of international law, such as the United Nations Charter.",156.0,234.0,16.0,1,9781849460897,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/8494/9781849460897.jpg,1849460892,9781849460897,en,2010-07-14,4.5,2,Human Dignity and the Foundations of International Law,438.0

What evidence is there for the Templars' guilt? What became of the Templars and their property after the end of the Order?

[385472],1835013,"[3240, 2785, 2842]","I have been asked many times why so much of what I write about - life after death, psychical research, and related paranormal subjects is taken from research done a hundred or more years ago, and why I don't write more about modern mediums and researchers. Part of the reason is that there has been relatively very little research looking at evidence of survival after death since 1930. But that is a secondary reason. The primary reason is that I am convinced that the phenomena observed by the pioneers of psychical research, especially in the area of mediumship and, concomitantly, in the area of spirit communication, were much more dynamic and evidential than those of today. Sometime around 1920, when Professor James Hyslop, one of the key pioneers, died, the research reached a point of diminishing returns. The scientists and scholars engaged in the research began to realize that they were continually reinventing the wheel and would never succeed in producing evidence to satisfy either the scientific fundamentalists or the religious fundamentalists. As strong as the evidence was, it did not offer the absolute proof the skeptics demanded. The pioneers were followed by researchers, who, having witnessed the derision heaped on their predesessors by materialistic ""know-nothings,"" were concerned with their reputations in academic circles. Since consciousness survival had come to be a taboo subject in academia, the new breed of researcher focused on ESP - often going out of their way to avoid the survival of consciousness issue. In fact, a fair percentage of parapsychologists, while accepting the reality of ESP, rejected the spirit or survival hypothesis, concluding that all such phenomena were somehow produced by the subconscious of the individuals involved in their experiments. Such a conclusion was much more academically and scientifically acceptable and made sure funds for further research were available. To even hint at the spirit hypothesis was to invite disdain. While a few later researchers delved into the area of past-life studies, their work received little attention from mainstream science and was ignored or resisted by orthodox religions. When, during the 1970s, research began in the field of near-death experiences, the researchers, wanting to be scientifically proper, focused more on the positive effects of the NDE than on the survival implications. It was not until late in the 1990s, when Dr. Gary Schwartz of the University of Arizona, began investigating the clairvoyant type of mediumship that survival research again resurfaced. But Schwartz came under attack by many scientific fundamentalists and research in this area was further discouraged. This volume, intended as the first of four volumes, covers the period before 1882, the year the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) was organized and more formal scientific methods were employed. The pre-1882 researchers were by no means ignorant of the scientific methods necessary to validate mediums, and it becomes clear to the discerning reader that these pioneers were very much on guard against deception and mindful of other explanations, including the subconscious theories. It also becomes apparent to the serious student of this subject that the earliest researchers went beyond the evidential aspects of mediumship and recorded many messages concerning the afterlife environment and the meaning of this life. They served as the foundation for a whole new philosophy, one that made some sense of the afterlife and gave meaning to this life.",152.0,229.0,10.0,1,9781908733009,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/9087/9781908733009.jpg,1908733004,9781908733009,en,2012-03-26,4.33,3,The Afterlife Explorers: v. 1 : The Pioneers of Psychical Research,262.0

Tobie Puttock gathers together 100 of his favourite Italian-inspired recipes, and shows us how to achieve authentic Italian flavours wherever we live.   Convinced that 'cooking and eating should be about nurturing the soul as well as the body', Tobie argues for the purchase and use of the best available produce. He shows us why organic is nearly always better and why eating seasonally is the way to go. He introduces us to growers whose respect for the cycles of nature is inspirational, and to suppliers whose enthusiasm for that particular brand of cheese or type of mushroom will have you rushing to your local market.   Because Tobie's approach is so produce-driven, his recipes are wonders of creation and innovation. Often, he sticks to the script of a great Italian classic such as Risotto Milanese. At other times, he improvises according to the availability of particular ingredients, resulting in some inspiring dishes such as Potato Gnocchi with Morels and Vanilla.

Based on unprecedented research in missionary archives as well as Jewish writings, the book analyzes the theology and activities of both the missions and the converts and describes the reactions of the Jewish community, which in turn helped to shape the evangelical activity directed toward it. Ariel delineates three successive waves of evangelism, the first directed toward poor Jewish immigrants, the second toward American-born Jews trying to assimilate, and the third toward Jewish baby boomers influenced by the counterculture of the Vietnam War era. After World War II, the missionary impulse became almost exclusively the realm of conservative evangelicals, as the more liberal segments of American Christianity took the path of interfaith dialogue. As Ariel shows, these missionary efforts have profoundly influenced Christian-Jewish relations. Jews have seen the missionary movement as a continuation of attempts to delegitimize Judaism and to do away with Jews through assimilation or annihilation. But to conservative evangelical Christians, who support the State of Israel, evangelizing Jews is a manifestation of goodwill toward them. |The first comprehensive history of Protestant evangelization of Jews in America to the present day.

Your indulgence in arts, drama, music and the creative arts often provides this entry into a world of glamour. You will look to be transported away from yourself and into a world where you can experience things that you would never usually experience. It can be a year of experiences that sweep you off your feet: a whirl wind romance, a unique travel opportunity, working with creative people on an important project or involvement in a movement which could have deep national or even international significance. Travelling with others to pursue joint interests is an important part of this year - the enjoyment in any moment is enhanced and magnified when shared. This is not a year to follow rules and to try desperately hard to be organised and systematic, it is a year to adapt and go with the flow, letting life take you on a magical mystery tour. While old ties are broken, new roots have not yet been set down and you feel in in state of flux and while this can be disconcerting; it is also inspiring as you feel that there is great potential there waiting to be tapped. The way forward is not obvious it must be taken step by step and with patience. Leadership for Pisces in 2017 is about seeing the future and selling that vision to those who have the practical skills to make it work. This is a consciousness and awareness expanding year of potential, possibilities and often mystery - but then life is the greatest mystery of all and that is very exciting.""

Carolyn Podruchny looks beyond the stereotypes and reveals the contours of voyageurs' lives, world views, and values. Making the Voyageur World shows that the voyageurs created distinct identities shaped by their French-Canadian peasant roots, the Aboriginal peoples they met in the Northwest, and the nature of their employment as indentured servants in diverse environments. Voyageurs' identities were also shaped by their constant travels and by their own masculine ideals that emphasized strength, endurance, and daring. Although voyageurs left few conventional traces of their own voices in the documentary record, an astonishing amount of information can be found in descriptions of them by their masters, explorers, and other travelers. By examining their lives in conjunction with the metaphor of the voyage, Podruchny not only reveals the everyday lives of her subjects-what they ate, their cosmology and rituals of celebration, their families, and, above all, their work-but also underscores their impact on the social and cultural landscape of North America.",152.0,229.0,22.1,1,9780803287907,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/8032/9780803287907.jpg,803287909,9780803287907,en,2006-12-01,3.75,36,Making the Voyageur World : Travelers and Traders in the North American Fur Trade,590.0

Long since out of print, this Quirin Pinyin Updated Editions (QPUE) Revised Edition offers the full original text with the following features: Older Wade-Giles transliteration fully updated and revised to the current Pinyin standard. Fully re-typeset and proofed for typographical errors and inconsistencies. Not to be confused with the earlier title by the same authors on the Zen koan, which is a much shorter preliminary version of the present volume, Zen Dust: The History of the Koan and Koan Study in Rinzai (Linji) Zen is divided into five main sections: Part One is an extensive essay by Ruth Fuller Sasaki on the history of the koan in Chinese and Japanese Rinzai Zen and how it developed into a unique technique to aid the monk in quest of enlightenment. Part Two is a translation of a series of lectures on koan study given by the Zen master Issh Miura R shi Part Three offers a selection of Zen phrases or capping phrases that were used as commentary and annotations to the often enigmatic koans. The notes to the first two sections of Zen Dust offer a veritable treasure trove of background information on the monks and masters that forged the koan-study tradition of Rinzai Zen in China and Japan. This is followed by an extensively descriptive bibliography that teases out the vast literature of Zen in particular and Buddhism in general by giving considerable background material not only on the content of the works but also the context in which they came to be put together. Along with the appendices, which include genealogical charts of Zen lines, and the extensive index, it is these last sections (totaling nearly 400 pages) that make Zen Dust an invaluable companion not only for students and Zen adepts seeking to delve in the unique spiritual training that koan study entails, but also for scholars and researchers of Zen Buddhism.

Cod, it turns out, is the reason Europeans set sail across the Atlantic, and it is the only reason they could. What did the Vikings eat in icy Greenland and on the five expeditions to America recorded in the Icelandic sagas? Cod, frozen and dried in the frosty air, then broken into pieces and eaten like hardtack. What was the staple of the medieval diet? Cod again, sold salted by the Basques, an enigmatic people with a mysterious, unlimited supply of cod.

He explores the whole process of adapting for the stage, and investigates the particular techniques - many of them highly sophisticated - that actors require when performing 'story-theatre'.  The book includes over two hundred exercises, improvisations and workshops dealing with the practical aspects of story-theatre, such as building an ensemble, creating a physical vocabulary, and transforming written narrative into drama. It draws on examples ranging from traditional legends and folklore, through the works of Jane Austen, Charles Dickens and Evelyn Waugh, to contemporary fiction. Alfreds shows how each story demands its own particular set of dramatic choices, opening up endless possibilities for performance.  Then What Happens - like the author's tremendously successful first book, Different Every Night - will be invaluable to directors and actors, to dramatists working in the field of adaptation, to those devising and working from improvisation, and to any theatregoer who has been moved by the power of an unfolding story to ask: 'Then what happens?'",156.0,234.0,25.4,1,9781848422704,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/8484/9781848422704.jpg,1848422709,9781848422704,en,2014-04-08,4.5,4,Then What Happens : Storytelling and Adapting for the Theatre,707.0

It is not a book to save the world, even though the world is clearly in trouble. Ultimately, Time's Up! is a book about survival; about ensuring that every individual human has the means to save herself or himself from the global crisis that is unfolding. People know that the climate is changing, that species are being removed from the Earth at a rapidly increasing rate, that entire ecosystems are becoming shadows of their former richness; they know, but they do not understand. The global environmental crisis is closing in on humanity from all directions, yet the crisis barely registers on this culture's list of problems. As we stand, humanity is doomed to a collapse that will leave only a few nomads, and a toxic, barely survivable Earth in its wake. So why is nothing being done beyond changing light bulbs, recycling and buying organic food? It's certainly not for a lack of good reasons. Humans have no motivation stronger than survival, yet the culture that dominates ""the culture we call Industrial Civilization"" has created a set of priorities that value financial wealth, the possession of superfluous goods and short, cheap thrills, above that most basic need. In short, we are prepared to die in order to live a life that is killing us. Time's Up! is all about changing this. It describes what our actions are doing to the very things on Earth that we depend on for survival, at scales that we rarely contemplate. It arms us with the tools to free us from the culture that has blinded us for centuries, and which will allow us to live lives that will give the Earth, and ourselves, a future.

If you never understood the term ""postmodernism"" or how ""literary alchemy"" is used by great authors from Shakespeare to J.K. Rowling, then this is a fun way to learn.

Several studies show that by using the method in this book, called Clinical EFT because it's the only version of EFT validated in dozens of clinical trials, you can lose weight, and keep it off permanently. One study found that people lost an average of 11 lb. in the year after a Clinical EFT weight loss program. In this book you'll hear from dozens of people who lost weight successfully with EFT. Their deeply moving stories tell how many other parts of their lives improved too, from skin tone to marriage, from self-confidence to financial abundance. That's because EFT, also called Tapping, eliminates stress. Author Dawson Church has conducted many scientific studies of EFT. These show that Clinical EFT reduces cortisol, your main stress hormone, while lowering anxiety, depression, and pain, leading to long-term weight loss. Clinical EFT has been used successfully by thousands of people to lose those unwanted pounds without expensive drugs or risky surgery, and is your proven solution to keeping weight off permanently. When you experience the simple, powerful, science-based solutions in these pages, you'll understand why tens of thousands of people like you have made EFT for Weight Loss the best-selling book on the subject ever published.",126.0,177.0,17.0,1,9781604152159,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/6041/9781604152159.jpg,160415215X,9781604152159,en,2013-10-01,3.89,19,EFT for Weight Loss,275.0

Analyzing key texts of the period, the authors articulate the characteristics of romantic thought and at the same time show historical and systematic connections with modern literary theory. Thus, The Literary Absolute renews contemporary scholarship, showing the romantic origins of some of the leading issues in current critical theory.",152.0,229.0,25.0,1,9780887066610,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/8870/9780887066610.jpg,887066615,9780887066610,en,1988-05-01,3.91,45,"Literary Absolute, The : The Theory of Literature in German Romanticism",236.0

This expanded edition offers new material that rereads and updates previous chapters, including a major new chapter on the role of race. The authors offer specific new classroom examples of how assumptions of privilege, specifically the workings of unacknowledged whiteness, shape classroom discourses. This edition also goes beyond the classroom, to examine the present context of American higher education.  Drawing on in-depth interviews and using the actual words of students and teachers, the authors take the reader into classrooms at six colleges and universities - Lewis and Clark College, Wheaton College, the University of Arizona, Towson State University, Spelman College, and San Francisco State University. The result is an intimate view of the pedagogical approaches of seventeen feminist college professors.  Feminist scholars have demonstrated that American higher education has long represented a white, male, privileged minority. The professors here bring together the twin upheavals that have challenged this tradition: namely a rapidly changing student body and the more inclusive knowledge of feminist and multicultural scholarship. They uncover the voices, concerns and experiences of groups hitherto marginalized in higher education: women, people of color and working class students.

Greenberg travels to Dean's hometown to talk with folks who knew the star, and all the way to the California roads that underlay the tires of the actor's infamous Porsche Spyder. Taking the story back and forth in time, Greenberg gives insight into what drove Dean to live on the edge - the early loss of his mother, his relentless drive to explore for the sake of his craft. Dean once said, ""Dream as if you'll live forever. Live as if you'll die today."" He lived to experience, and the one love that compared to his love of acting was his love of racing cars.

The star's too-soon departure froze him as a symbol of American Cool, and as proven by the 20 000 people who return to Dean's grave each year to pay homage, a major influence on youth culture for myriad generations.

A bird much more often heard than actually seen, and often mistaken for a hawk or falcon when briefly glimpsed in flight. Cuckoos are also well known, perhaps even infamous, for their habit of laying their own eggs into the nests of much smaller species, such as reed warblers, who are then doomed to raise the enormous cuckoo chick rather than their own young, and whose eggs are ruthlessly thrown from the nest by the cuckoo hatchling. But how does this complex behaviour act out in nature, and how did it evolve? What are the cuckoo's special tricks and what counter-measures have the host birds developed to resist the depredations of cuckoos? In this book the authors delve into the stories behind what we see, and into the complex and ever evolving evolutionary arms race by which the nest parasite and its hosts constantly try to leapfrog each other into prime position. The natural history of the cuckoo-host struggle is illuminated with detailed explanations of the results of behavioural and ecological research to provide a comprehensive, but highly readable, account in which an insight into one puzzle constantly reveals a new question begging an answer. The whole story is brought vividly to life through the astonishing photographs of Oldo Mikulica, who has watched cuckoos and their various hosts from hides for almost four decades.

In a period in which women's reproductive lives are imperiled, Reproductive Justice provides an essential guide to understanding and mobilizing around women's human rights in the twenty-first century.",140.0,210.0,28.0,1,9780520288201,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/5202/9780520288201.jpg,520288203,9780520288201,en,2017-04-11,4.54,173,Reproductive Justice : An Introduction,454.0

When the Anti-Defamation League sent a young Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein to Chicago to foster interfaith relations in the late 1970's, he was surprised to see how responsive Christian evangelicals were to the cause of supporting and defending Israel. Eckstein founded The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews in 1983 to promote cross-cultural understanding and build broad support for Israel, Soviet Jewry, and other shared concerns. The Fellowship has grown and thrived over the last three decades, raising more than $1.1 billion, and is one of the largest 50 NGOs in America today.

The critique of essentialism' (i.e. there is no specifically feminine essence) proposed by both gender theory and deconstruction is just one more twist in the ontological negation of the feminine.

She theorizes the black femme as a figure who, even when not explicitly represented within hegemonic cinematic formulations of raced and gendered subjectivities, nonetheless haunts those representations, threatening to disrupt them by making alternative social arrangements visible.Keeling draws on the thought of Frantz Fanon, Angela Davis, Karl Marx, Antonio Gramsci, and others in addition to Deleuze. She pursues the elusive figure of the black femme through Haile Gerima's film Sankofa, images of women in the Black Panther Party, Pam Grier's roles in the blaxploitation films of the early 1970s, F.

The meditation technique described in the book is a straightforward, silent method; the book's description of meditation has been characterized as 'Zen with details'. The meditation technique, set forth in poetic language, reduces to a formula of sitting, breathing and contemplating. Sitting primarily relates to a straight posture. Breathing is described in detail, primarily in terms of the esoteric physiology of the path of ""qi"" (also known as ""chi"" or ""ki""), or breath energy. The energy path associated with breathing has been described as similar to an internal wheel vertically aligned with the spine. When breathing is steady, the wheel turns forward, with breath energy rising in back and descending in front. Bad breathing habits (or bad posture, or even bad thoughts) may cause the wheel not to turn, or move backward, inhibiting the circulation of essential breath energy.

Also known as the lemniscate, this powerful symbol stands for equilibrium, harmony, and the interconnectedness of all things. Although magical knowledge of symbols has often been kept secret throughout history, today the power of this symbol is available to all. In this accessible, hands-on guide, Barbara Heider-Rauter explores the spiritual world of the infinity symbol in a personal and practical way, allowing each of us to benefit from its positive influence for balance and harmony in ourselves, our relationships, and the wider world. She begins with a short exercise to attune readers to the energy field of the lemniscate. She explains how the infinity symbol offers the perfect response to a system that encourages separation and a world in which the negation of our feelings is often the source of illness and pain. She details simple exercises to reconnect the two halves of the brain, the analytical and the emotional, resulting in harmony and healing. She teaches how to use simple visualisation, physical exercises, and directed drawing of the symbol to achieve practical results in our daily lives. Beautifully illustrated in full color, the book also offers a wealth of information on the appearance of the infinity symbol through the ages in all its forms and contexts, from history and mythology to our own tiny body cells and the natural world.

Becoming an advocate for plant-based nutrition free of disease-inducing animal protein, synthetic chemicals, and heat-generated toxins, McCabe coined the term ""raw vegan."" It is now an internationally recognized definition of what is becoming an increasingly popular dietary choice of unprocessed, unheated, fresh, organic, plant-based foods rich in the nutrients on which humans thrive in health. In this book of easy, simple, no-nonsense recipes, McCabe provides a variety of dishes that are easy to make, low-fat, rich in nutrients, and diverse enough to satisfy a wide variety of preferences. As an author of numerous books and a ghost co-author of many books by other writers, McCabe has had his hand in more raw vegan books than any other writer. His books sell internationally and include ""Sunfood Diet Infusion,"" ""Sunfood Traveler,"" ""Vegan Myth Vegan Truth,"" ""Extinction,"" and ""Igniting Your Life."" And now, this simple little recipe book that will be a nice addition to the kitchen of any person interested in healthy dietary choices. With this book, McCabe continues his global influence, playing a role in creating a raw vegan culture that is flourishing in some regions while beginning to blossom in countries the world over. While California is considered the epicenter of raw vegan cuisine, interest has gone global. From South Africa to Northern Europe, New Zealand and Australia to Asia, and throughout the Americas, raw vegan culture continues to evolve into a force that has become an industry and lifestyle influencing everything from what is being grown on farms and home gardens, to what is being served in restaurants and sold in stores.

[422781],77772,[3196],"'Hearts Turn' is a singular and gripping exploration of the act of 'tawba', a Qur'anic term commonly translated as repentance. In English, repentance is a forbidding word that suggests a puritanical finality. But in Arabic the term 'tawba' is dynamic, meaning to 'turn' or 'return'. 'At-Tawwab' is one of the Names of God, the Oft-Returning or Ever-Relenting. It is an active constant, an ongoing, compassionate reality that renews every moment we are alive. The process of purification is a process of continuous turning. In 'Hearts Turn' Michael Sugich, author of 'Signs on the Horizons', tells stories that are harrowing and hilarious, heartrending and bizarre, profane and transcendent, and altogether full of hope, showing how men and women from many parts of the world and many walks of life have turned themselves around and taken a fork in the road toward a higher reality. ""This book is a declaration of mercy and certainty. Formed of a collection of stories I've experienced, read or heard, about how malleable the human heart can be and how wrongdoing, remorse, need, and yearning intersect with Divine Compassion, Forgiveness and Guidance. It is also about the sudden transitions from confusion to clarity, from sin to virtue, from sleep to wakefulness, from ignorance to knowledge, from foolishness to wisdom. And finally it is about the path of our lives, which leads us gradually, and for those who God favors, inexorably to salvation."" From the introduction to 'Hearts Turn'""Magnificent!...Interlacing ancient and modern experiences of the unexpected presence of God, this unique anthology of conversion stories reminds us of the ongoing spiritual power of Islamic faith."" Dr. Timothy Winter (Shaykh Abdal Hakim Murad) Dean of Cambridge Muslim College""Michael Sugich is a master storyteller as he demonstrated in 'Signs on the Horizons'. 'Hearts Turn' is a brilliantly written reminder that God's Mercy is always open to each of us, no matter our position in life. This book has the power to leave the reader wanting to turn to God and to His Mercy. I loved this book.""

It is here that young Daniel Laverock, starving and nearly penniless at the height of the Great Depression, takes the only job he can find: manager of the Pantheon Theater, a rundown old silent cinema owned by Sam Yudenow. Yudenow, an incorrigible swindler and one of the great comic grotesques in English literature, at first seems merely an amusing old fool, but Laverock soon discovers he is actually a despicable rogue. And when one of Yudenow's schemes finally goes too far, Laverock and his co-worker Copper Baldwin decide to teach him a lesson with a grand scheme of their own, with hilarious and unpredictable results.  First published in 1957, Fowlers End is thought by many to be the masterpiece of Gerald Kersh (1911-1968). A comic romp with echoes of Dickens, Rabelais, and The Beggar's Opera, Kersh's novel remains one of the funniest English novels of the 20th century and one of the best works of fiction ever written about London.

This book isn't meant as a definitive scholarly tome for academics. but a practical kit for working authors who want to refine their voice. I'll avoid literary theory and grammatical jargon. Instead, I'll give you useful tools. Novice writers can have inspiring fun playing with euphonics. In the hands of skilled writers - for whom this guide is intended - euphonics are power tools. Euphonics can't replace basic fiction crafting skills, but they can add impact and polish to a well-written piece. In print, the effects are very subtle, serving only to enhance what's already there, and need to be combined with other techniques. But if you plan to perform author readings or release an audiobook, the euphonics will hold listeners enthralled with poetic power. I'm writing in British English. Some spellings, grammatical rules and word choices differ from American English, but the euphonic effects are the same.

Grossman and Scheibel explore the influences of melodrama and film noir, the significance around the idea of ""home,"" as well as female trauma and agency. In addition to this close investigation of the series itself, the authors examine the rich storytelling surrounding Twin Peaks that includes the film prequel, Mark Frost's novels, and Showtime's 2017 revival. In Twin Peaks, Grossman and Scheibel argue that the show has transcended conventional binaries not only in film and television but also in culture and gender. The book begins with a look into the publicity and critical discourses on authorship that framed Twin Peaks as an auteurist project rather than a prime-time soap opera. Despite critics' attempts to distance the series from the soap opera genre, Grossman and Scheibel explore how melodrama and noir are used in Twin Peaks. Grossman and Scheibel masterfully examine star performances in the series including Kyle MacLachlan's epic portrayal as the idiosyncratic Special Agent Dale Cooper and Sheryl Lee's haunting embodiment of Laura Palmer. The monograph finishes with an examination of the adaptation and remediation of Twin Peaks in a variety of different platforms, which have further expanded the boundaries of the series.

It covers the concept of ijtihād (independent reasoning), its conditions and application and illustrates why it is a practice for experts rather than laymen. It also explains the differences in the levels of expertise of the mujtahids. In fact, there are seven distinct classifications of mujtahid. The book also covers the communication of God as Lawgiver with regard to the conduct of liable persons. It details the difference in probative value of communication based on the extent to which it binds an individual be it absolutely binding, a recommendation or mere permissibility. The reader will be able to understand the difference between fiqh (law) and Usūl al-Fiqh (methodology of law). Fiqh is the law itself whereas Usūl al-Fiqh is the methodology utilized to extract the law. The relationship between the two disciplines resembles that of the rules of grammar to a language, or of logic to philosophy. Usūl al-Fiqh in this sense provides the standard criteria for the correct deduction of the rulings of fiqh from the sources of Shari'ah (the Qur'an and Sunnah).",155.0,230.0,27.94,1,9781597843492,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/5978/9781597843492.jpg,1597843490,9781597843492,en,2020-10-01,5.0,1,Usul al-Fiqh : Methodology of Islamic Jurisprudence,540.0

One morning in February 2001, internet entrepreneur Josh Harris woke to certain knowledge that he was about to lose everything. The man Time magazine called ""The Warhol of the Web"" was now reduced to the role of helpless spectator as his personal fortune dwindled from 85 million dollars, to 50 million, to nothing, all in the space of a week.  Harris had been New York's first net millionaire, a maverick genius so preternaturally adapted to the fluid virtualities of the new online world that he saw it with a clarity almost no one else did. He founded the city's first dotcom, Pseudo.com, and paved the way for a cadre of net-savvy twentysomethings to follow, riding a wave of tech euphoria to unimagined wealth and fame for five years, before losing it all in the great dotcom crash of 2000, in which Web 1.0 was wiped from the face of the earth. Long before then, however, Harris's view of where the web would take us had darkened, and he began a series of lurid social experiments aimed at illustrating his worst fear: that the internet would soon alter the very fabric of society--cognitive, social, political, and otherwise.  In Totally Wired, award-winning author and journalist Andrew Smith seeks to unravel the opaque and mysterious episodes of the twentieth century dotcom craze, in which the seeds of our current reality were sown. Drawing on in-depth interviews with Harris and the former pioneers who worked alongside him in downtown Manhattan's ""Silicon Alley,"" the narrative moves from a compound in the wild south of Ethiopia, through New York, San Francisco, Las Vegas, London and Salt Lake City, Utah; from the dawn of the web to the present, taking in the rise of retro-truth, troll society, the unexpected origins of the net itself, as our world has grown uncannily to resemble the one Harris predicted--and had urged us to evade.",139.7,208.28,33.02,1,9780802129345,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/8021/9780802129345.jpg,080212934X,9780802129345,en,2019-03-12,3.6,69,Totally Wired : The Rise and Fall of Josh Harris and the Great Dotcom Swindle,385.55

Included are more profiles, over 50 more photos and several new chapters. Kokeshi are the traditional dolls that are made of wood and are characterized by their lack of arms or legs. They are produced in the Tohoku region of Japan and were originally a children's toy, although it is more often used as a form of decoration nowadays and displayed in the home. Abroad, they are considered to be an icon of Japan, and reflect Japanese aesthetic sensibilities with their simple, elegant and minimalist designs. Kokeshi have the appeal of imperfection and hand made exclusivity as no two dolls are the same, each kokeshi embodies the qualities of wood, something that is often referred to as ""warmth."" In fact, for collectors, more than the freshly made kokeshi, many covet the atmosphere of the vintage kokeshi -- rather than degrading, as with plastic or artificial materials, the wood picks up a dewy, subdued colour and the delicately painted features fade gracefully with time. This book is the only English language book that looks at this culture in depth, and is the only book with English language interviews with the masters of the craft. The author, Manami Okazaki, visits all 6 prefectures of Tohoku to profile 23 artisans in the remote hot spring villages where they are made. Included are the work and interviews with the masters to the up and coming artists, and highlights many aesthetic theories and sensibilities that are prevalent in contemporary design, even today. The book also looks at Japanese hotspring culture, and Tohoku culture to paint a holistic picture of kokeshi culture. This book will delight fans of wooden crafts, Japanese culture and travellers to Japan. The book gives an insight into the psychology of the craftsman, the process of production, the motifs and the various types, which will inform the collector. This book will also suit travelers to Japan who wish to explore the Northern region of Japan, and their charming hot spring villages.

Nowhere else in modern history do we find so pronounced an example of government sponsorship of a religion as in Japan's support of shinto. How did that sponsorship come about and how was it maintained? How was it dismantled after World War II? What attempts are being made today to reconstruct it? In answering these questions, Hardacre shows why State shinto symbols, such as the Yasukuni Shrine and its prefectural branches, are still the focus for bitter struggles over who will have the right to articulate their significance. Where previous studies have emphasized the state bureaucracy responsible for the administration of shinto, Hardacre goes to the periphery of Japanese society.",152.0,229.0,13.46,1,9780691020525,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/mid/9780/6910/9780691020525.jpg,691020523,9780691020525,en,1991-09-01,4.0,34,"Shinto and the State, 1868-1988",312.0

Such phenomenal growth was never a sure thing - in its first decades, the town languished as a railroad company town and market center for nearby ranches and mines. The construction of Hoover Dam in the 1930s brought thousands of workers, some of whom decided to stay, and World War II and the Cold War brought others, including military personnel and workers at the Nevada Test Site. But it was when Nevada legalized casino gambling in 1931 that Las Vegas met its destiny. This act, combined with the growing popularity of the automobile, cheap land and electricity, and changing national attitudes toward gambling, led to the fantastical casinos and opulent resorts that became the trademark industry of the city and created the ambiance that has made Las Vegas an international icon of pleasure and entertainment. Eugene Moehring and Michael Green have studied and written about Las Vegas for many years, and in Las Vegas: A Centennial History they offer a detailed and deeply knowledgeable account of the growth of this unique city, the impact of politics and of wars, and the city's struggle to establish diversified economy. Here are the larger-than-life characters who shaped the city, as well as the business and civic decisions. The authors' scope extends chronologically from the first Paiute people who settled around the artesian springs that gave the city its name, right up to the construction of the latest megaresort, and geographically far beyond the original township to include the several municipalities that make up the metropolitan Las Vegas area. They consider various aspects of city building such as the role of developers; the creation of infrastructure, services, and transportation; the struggle to obtain a reliable source of water; the function of cultural, civic, educational, and religious institutions; and of ethnic minorities. Las Vegas: A Centennial History celebrates the city's unparalleled growth in the brief century of its existence. It also offers fresh insight into the process of city building in the American West, where urban needs and aspirations must contend with water scarcity, isolation, erratic economies, highly diverse populations, and the rocky relationship between the need for civic order and the Western spirit of independence. That Las Vegas has become one of the nation's major cities in so brief a time reflects the prodigious energies of its people and a happy convergence of events and circumstances. Its story will engage residents and visitors alike, as well as all readers interested in the history and workings of an American city.",181.36,229.11,18.8,1,9780874176155,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/8741/9780874176155.jpg,874176158,9780874176155,en,2005-03-31,3.23,13,Las Vegas : A Centennial History,494.42

Inspired by ancient pottery fragments from a tradition that had disappeared before the arrival of the first Europeans, a self-taught woodcutter-turned-artist reinvented an entire ceramic technology. Today Casas Grandes pottery, made by hand from local clays and mineral colors by a handful of artists, claims high prices and sets the standard for contemporary pottery.

His aim is to show in pitiless detail the horrors of the Japanese Army's seizure and capture of Nanjing in December 1937. Unvarnished accounts of the testimony - Chinese victims and Japanese perpetrators - to the rape and slaughter are juxtaposed with public relations announcements of the Japanese Army as printed in various Japanese newspapers of the time. The bland announcements of triumphant victories stand in bitter contrast to the atrocities that actually took place on the scene. The story unfolds with horrible detail as we watch the triumphant progress of the Japanese army whose troops were bent on rape and killing in the so-called ""heat of battle."" Yet by recalling the testimony of Japanese soldiers and reporters who were on the scene, as well as reproducing dispatches by Japanese Army authorities at the time, Honda makes it clear that the atrocities were part of a studied effort directed by the Japanese high command to impress the Chinese people with the power of its army and the folly of resistance to it - the estimate of 300,000 killed in these ""military operations"" is no exaggeratoin. Honda has worked with other Japanese journalists and scholars who have attempted to reveal the truth of the Nanjing massacre, provoked by the efforts of right-wing Japanese, including, sadly, many government officials, to whitewash the whole incident, even to the point of contending that a ""massacre"" never happened.

As it grows in power and wealth, geopolitical competition has reemerged, threatening future stability not merely in Asia but around the globe. China is aggressive and uncooperative, and increasingly expects the world to bend to its wishes. The focus on Sino-US competition for global power has obscured 'Asia's other great game': the rivalry between Japan and China. A modernizing India risks missing out on the energies and talents of millions of its women, potentially hampering the broader role it can play in the world. And in North Korea, the most frightening question raised by Kim Jong-un's pursuit of the ultimate weapon is also the simplest: can he control his nukes? In Asia's New Geopolitics: Essays on Reshaping the Indo-Pacific, Michael R. Auslin examines these and other key issues transforming the Indo-Pacific and the broader world. He also explores the history of American strategy in Asia from the 18th century through today. Taken together, Auslin's essays convey the richness and diversity of the region: with more than three billion people, the Indo-Pacific contains over half of the global population, including the world's two most populous nations: India and China. In a riveting final chapter, Auslin imagines a war between America and China in a bid for regional hegemony and what this conflict might look like.",152.0,229.0,23.0,1,9780817923259,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/8179/9780817923259.jpg,081792325X,9780817923259,en,2020-11-30,4.03,32,Asia's New Geopolitics : Essays on Reshaping the Indo-Pacific,340.19

People are curious about and often confused by the things that arouse them, yet they are often too ashamed to reveal their most private fantasies to their partners or even their therapists. In this fascinating and provocative book, Dr. Michael J. Bader offers a groundbreaking new theory of sexual desire, one that will liberate men and women and enable them to better understand their sexual preferences. Drawing on his twenty-five years as a psychotherapist and psychoanalyst, Dr. Bader demonstrates that rather than being programmed by biology or society, sexual fantasies and preferences are really psychological antidotes to unconscious dangers. Armed with this novel theory, men and women will no longer need to feel ashamed about what arouses them or confused about what arouses others. Dr. Bader sensitively tells the stories of his patients and explains the meaning of their sexual fantasies. In terms refreshingly free of jargon, he reveals how his profound new theory can be used to decipher a wide variety of sexual fantasies and behavior, ranging from ordinary preferences about positions in bed to flamboyant scenarios worthy of the Marquis de Sade. And yet, Dr. Bader's exciting new theory transcends the realm of individual psychology. Readers will come away with a radically new understanding of such issues as sexual chemistry and boredom, cybersex, pornography, and the differences in how men and women get excited.

So begins this epic, mesmerizing first novel by Gregory David Roberts, set in the underworld of contemporary Bombay. Shantaram is narrated by Lin, an escaped convict with a false passport who flees maximum security prison in Australia for the teeming streets of a city where he can disappear. Accompanied by his guide and faithful friend, Prabaker, the two enter Bombay's hidden society of beggars and gangsters, prostitutes and holy men, soldiers and actors, and Indians and exiles from other countries, who seek in this remarkable place what they cannot find elsewhere. As a hunted man without a home, family, or identity, Lin searches for love and meaning while running a clinic in one of the city's poorest slums, and serving his apprenticeship in the dark arts of the Bombay mafia. The search leads him to war, prison torture, murder, and a series of enigmatic and bloody betrayals. The keys to unlock the mysteries and intrigues that bind Lin are held by two people. The first is Khader Khan: mafia godfather, criminal-philosopher-saint, and mentor to Lin in the underworld of the Golden City. The second is Karla: elusive, dangerous, and beautiful, whose passions are driven by secrets that torment her and yet give her a terrible power. Burning slums and five-star hotels, romantic love and prison agonies, criminal wars and Bollywood films, spiritual gurus and mujaheddin guerrillas---this huge novel has the world of human experience in its reach, and a passionate love for India at its heart.

Eco's novel is examined in the light of several of the traditions from which it draws: theories of detective fiction, comedy, postmodernism, the apocalypse, semiotics, and literary criticism. The authors from a variety of language disciplines frequently draw on Eco's own scholarly commentaries to elucidate the novel. The Name of the Rose was published in English in the United States in 1983 and remained on the best-seller list for forty weeks. Paperback publication rights brought the highest price ever paid for a translation, and in 1986 it became a major motion picture. Written by a distinguished professor of semiotics at the University of Bologna, the novel was an immediate bestseller in Italy in 1980 and was subsequently translated into twenty languages to universal acclaim.The question all this raises is, how can such a novel be so popular--a detective set in a medieval monastery, which entertains at the same time as it deals with theology, history, politics, humanism, comedy, literary criticism, and just about everything else that makes up culture and society?  Is it possible that a popular piece of fiction, accessible to general readers, can also address complex and profound ideas? This volume of essays on the celebrated novel is the first of several books to be written in appreciation of Eco's remarkable accomplishment. It has the distinction also of including a foreword written by Eco himself in response to the essays, certainly one of the few times when the author has agreed to critique his critics. In addition, this collection contains a bibliography of Eco criticism.Just as The Name of the Rose has something for everyone, so too does this book of critical essays.

In fourteen powerful chapters, the authors explore such topics as How Jesus managed power. The intentional decisions necessary to move down. The uplifting nature of true humility. Abundant life through dying to self. The ambush of joy. Moving down is never an easy matter that can be reduced to a formula. It involves a life committed to discipleship. Descending into Greatness introduces you to the touching stories of modern men and women committed to advancing the kingdom of God: from the pro football player, to the medical missionary, to a businessman wrestling with the priorities in the world of finance. Descending into Greatness asks tough questions and gives hopeful answers. Now, this powerful, urgent message also includes a discussion guide so that you can follow through, too.

Blavatsky, the mysterious Russian woman who was the spiritual founder of the Theosophical Society. With the help of the equally mysterious Mahatmas who were her teachers, Blavatsky claimed to have brought the ""ancient wisdom of the East"" to the rescue of a materialistic West. In England, Blavatsky's earliest followers were mostly men, but a generation later the Theosophical Society was dominated by women, and theosophy had become a crucial part of feminist political culture. Divine Feminine is the first full-length study of the relationship between alternative or esoteric spirituality and the feminist movement in England. Historian Joy Dixon examines the Theosophical Society's claims that women and the East were the repositories of spiritual forces which English men had forfeited in their scramble for material and imperial power. Theosophists produced arguments that became key tools in many feminist campaigns.

Originating with the sacred harvest of hallucinogenic mushrooms from the corpses of shamans and other holy men, these acts of ritual cannibalism and visionary intoxication are part of the history of all cultures, including Judeo-Christian ones, and provided a way to commune with the dead. These practices continued openly into the Dark Ages, when they were suppressed and adapted into the worship of saintly bones--or continued in secret by a few ""heretical"" sects, such as the Cathars and the Knights Templar. While little known today, these rites remain deeply embedded in the symbolism, theology, and sacraments of modern religion and bring a much more literal meaning to the church's ""Holy Communion"" or symbolic consumption of the body and blood of Christ.

Under the best of circumstances, adolescence is a trying time for young people and their families. The budding adult seeks independence and autonomy while the resistant child within longs for protection and structure; questions about sexuality and work, social commitments, and solitary accomplishments loom large and can create a family battlefield. For the challenged and challenging young people with FAS/E, the circumstances as they begin maturing are never the best. In this sequel to Fantastic Antone Succeeds, young people with FAS/E and their caregivers report on their experiences coping with the problems of adolescence and young adulthood. Again the editors and authors have concentrated on the wisdom of practice, as they candidly convey which techniques worked and which did not during the difficult passages of the teenage years and beyond. The twenty-one chapters are grouped according to theme. Section one discusses the meaning of success for adolescents and adults with FAS/E -- the need to define success in new ways. Cindy Gere found her path to success, for example, through creative expression. She graduated from college with a degree in fine arts and successfully completed a program in art. Many of her paintings, including the one illustrating the cover of this book, provide a poignant and candid expression of what FAS/E means to her. Section two discusses strategies that work in areas such as counseling, education, sexuality, trouble with the law, and independent living. Section three covers what families need from the community, including innovative programs that help individuals with FAS/E, and how to get a diagnosis at adolescence.

This book demonstrates how to use a wide range of yoga postures, purification practices, breathing exercises and meditation practices as a portal to a higher consciousness - with all the everyday benefits implied in that phrase: an enhanced sense of peace, love, joy, happiness, harmony and personal fulfilment.  Drawing upon the tradition of Kriya Yoga - the goal of which is to attune one's individual consciousness with the Divine, or Universal, Consciousness - Stephen Sturgess shows us how to progress beyond the supple body to the vital, contented mind. His approach is based on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, whose wisdom punctuates the book. If we learn how to interiorize our concentration, and magnetize the spine and brain via the chakras, life energy is drawn back to the original centres of discharge and experienced as light, taking us into the consciousness of the Self.

Statius chose his subject well: the Rome of his day, ruled by the emperor Domitian, was not too distant from the civil wars that had threatened the survival of the empire. Published in 92 A.D., the  Thebaid was an immediate success, and its fame grew in succeeding centuries. It reached its peak of popularity in the later Middle Ages and Renaissance, influencing Dante, Chaucer, and perhaps Shakespeare. In recent times, however, it has received perhaps less attention than it deserves, in large part because there has been no accessible, dynamic translation of the work into English.

She encourages us to spend a lot of time outdoors, immersed in nature and handling natural objects and collecting experiences on which to base the rest of their education. She discusses the use of training in good habits such as attention, thinking, imagining, remembering, performing tasks with perfect execution, obedience, and truthfulness, to replace undesirable tendencies in children (and the adults that they grow into). She details how lessons in various school subjects can be done using her approach. She concludes with remarks about the Will, the Conscience, and the Divine Life in the Child. Charlotte Mason was a late nineteenth-century British educator whose ideas were far ahead of her time. She believed that children are born persons worthy of respect, rather than blank slates, and that it was better to feed their growing minds with living literature and vital ideas and knowledge, rather than dry facts and knowledge filtered and pre-digested by the teacher. Her method of education, still used by some private schools and many homeschooling families, is gentle and flexible, especially with younger children, and includes first-hand exposure to great and noble ideas through books in each school subject, conveying wonder and arousing curiosity, and through reflection upon great art, music, and poetry; nature observation as the primary means of early science teaching; use of manipulatives and real-life application to understand mathematical concepts and learning to reason, rather than rote memorization and working endless sums; and an emphasis on character and on cultivating and maintaining good personal habits. Schooling is teacher-directed, not child-led, but school time should be short enough to allow students free time to play and to pursue their own worthy interests such as handicrafts.
